      "abstract": "Multi-omics data, i.e., genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, characterize cellular complex signaling systems from multi-level and multi-view and provide a holistic view of complex cellular signaling pathways. However, it remains challenging to integrate and interpret multi-omics data for mining key disease targets and signaling pathways. Graph AI models have been widely used to analyze graph-structure datasets, and are ideal for integrative multi-omics data analysis because they can naturally integrate and represent multi-omics data as a biologically meaningful multi-level signaling graph and interpret multi-omics data via graph node and edge ranking analysis. However, it is non-trivial for graph-AI model developers to pre-analyze multi-omics data and convert the data into biologically meaningful graphs, which can be directly fed into graph-AI models. To resolve this challenge, we developed mosGraphGen (multi-omics signaling graph generator), generating Multi-omics Signaling graphs (mos-graph) of individual samples by mapping multi-omics data onto a biologically meaningful multi-level background signaling network with data normalization by aggregating measurements and aligning to the reference genome. With mosGraphGen, AI model developers can directly apply and evaluate their models using these mos-graphs. In the results, mosGraphGen was used and illustrated using two widely used multi-omics datasets of TCGA and Alzheimers disease (AD) samples.

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the progressive loss of neuronal tissue, and the accumulation of amyloid fibrils. Currently, there are no therapeutics that remove these amyloids. Targeted protein degradation could be a promising strategy to remove fibrils or oligomeric precursors. This approach requires degraders that specifically recognise amyloid fibrils, preferentially in early stages. Here, we introduce FibrilPaint20 (FP20), a peptide that specifically mediates the ubiquitination of amyloid fibrils. It acts as a PROTAC, containing both of a fibril recognition module and a recruitment motif for the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Importantly, FP20 does not bind to the functional monomer but exclusively to fibrils. Remarkably, FP20 ubiquitinates a set chemically diverse fibrils, unrelated in sequence and morphology. This includes fibrils of the disease-related proteins of -synuclein, A{beta}, Huntingtin and various Tau species, such as patient-derived fibrils from Alzheimer, Frontotemporal Dementia and Corticobasal Degeneration. This makes FP20 interesting for targeting mixed pathologies. Together, FP20 is an attractive lead compound for targeted protein degradation of amyloid fibrils.",

This study presents an innovative approach to drug development by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to identify the potential BACE1 inhibitors. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of protein-ligand interactions, the current study employed a machine learning model to generate novel ligands with high binding affinity and specificity for the BACE1 active site. The models efficacy was validated through molecular docking studies, which demonstrated superior binding affinities compared to existing FDA-approved inhibitors such as Atabecestat and Lanabecestat. The findings reveal that the top candidate, MLC10, exhibits a unique mechanism of action by promoting controlled flexibility in BACE1, contrasting with the rigid conformations induced by traditional inhibitors. This dynamic modulation enhances the enzymes inhibition, suggesting a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, solvent-accessible surface area analyses indicate that MLC10 facilitates a more favourable protein conformation, potentially altering catalytic behaviour through increased solvent interactions. This work underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in drug discovery, paving the way for the development of next-generation BACE1 inhibitors. By harnessing computational techniques, the present work aims to address the limitations of current therapies and contribute to more effective treatments for Alzheimers disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",

Eventually, neuronal death is only a question of time. The only way to prevent this outcome is to ensure that the degradation machinery for A{beta} peptides and their aggregates remains functional. A threshold value of accumulated neurotoxicity is suggested. If this value is exceeded, nearby neurons die. The progression of accumulated neurotoxicity over time is analyzed.

Furthermore, as the model indicates that accumulated neurotoxicity increases with the duration of the aggregation process, it implies that if the protein degradation system is compromised, the onset of AD becomes unavoidable. Eventually, neuronal death is only a question of time. The only way to prevent this outcome is to ensure that the degradation machinery for A{beta} peptides and their aggregates remains functional. A threshold value of accumulated neurotoxicity is suggested. If this value is exceeded, nearby neurons die. The progression of accumulated neurotoxicity over time is analyzed. An S-shaped growth pattern as the half-deposition time of A{beta} aggregates into senile plaques increases is revealed. Additionally, the sensitivity of accumulated neurotoxicity to different parameter values is examined.",

      "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques and surrounding glial activation are prominent histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimers Disease (AD). However, it is unclear how A{beta} plaques interact with surrounding glial cells in the human brain. Here, we applied spatial transcriptomics (ST) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for A{beta}, GFAP, and IBA1 to acquire data from 258,987 ST spots within 78 postmortem brain sections of 21 individuals. By coupling ST and adjacent-section IHC, we showed that low A{beta} spots exhibit transcriptomic profiles indicative of greater neuronal loss than high A{beta} spots, and high-glia spots present transcriptomic changes indicative of more significant inflammation and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we observed that this ST glial response bears signatures of reported mouse gene modules of plaque-induced genes (PIG), oligodendrocyte (OLIG) response, disease-associated microglia (DAM), and disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), as well as different microglia (MG) states identified in human AD brains, indicating that multiple glial cell states arise around plaques and contribute to local immune response. We then validated the observed effects of A{beta} on cell apoptosis and plaque-surrounding glia on inflammation and synaptic loss using IHC. In addition, transcriptomic changes of iPSC-derived microglia-like cells upon short-interval A{beta} treatment mimic the ST glial response and mirror the reported activated MG states. Our results demonstrate an exacerbation of synaptic and neuronal loss in low-A{beta} or high-glia areas, indicating that microglia response to A{beta}-oligomers likely initiates glial activation in plaque-glia niches. Our study lays the groundwork for future pathology genomics studies, opening the door for investigating pathological heterogeneity and causal effects in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Their multifaceted roles in health and disease have garnered significant attention in the context of neurodegeneration. In recent years, single-cell transcriptomic techniques have provided unprecedented insights into microglial heterogeneity, revealing distinct subpopulations and gene expression patterns associated with neuroprotection or neurotoxicity.\n\nHere, the transcriptomic landscape of microglia has been dissected by leveraging human single-nuclei RNA sequencing datasets of neurodegenerative conditions, encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimers disease, aging, and Parkinsons disease.

Moreover, distinct gene signatures and regulatory networks linked to inflammation and neurodegeneration have been identified.\n\nOverall, the study provides an improved portrait of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, and it holds promise for developing a more targeted research aimed at modulating microglial function to mitigate disease progression and foster neuroprotection.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBrain-resident microglia cells show a profound transcriptional heterogeneity\nC_LIO_LIMicroglia are not subject to a macrophage-like polarization mechanism\nC_LIO_LINeurodegenerative disorders share common transcriptional programs, yet retaining their own peculiarities\nC_LIO_LIDistinct gene regulatory networks underlie microglia heterogeneity and neurodegeneration-related dysfunctions\nC_LI",

      "abstract": "One key limitation in developing effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of models accurately mimicking the complex physiopathology of the human disease. Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside neurons that synthesize catecholamines. Neurons reaching the highest neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinsons, Alzheimers and apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken into consideration in current animal models because common laboratory species, such as rodents, do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generate a tissue-specific transgenic mouse, termed tgNM, that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase. We show that, in parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages. This model may open new research avenues in brain aging and neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is an early site of pathology in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), and it undergoes catastrophic degeneration later in both disorders. Dysregulation of the LC is thought to contribute to prodromal symptoms of AD and PD such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, while frank LC-NE loss promotes cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms responsible for its selective vulnerability are unknown. The LC is among the only structures in the brain that produces appreciable amounts of neuromelanin (NM), a dark cytoplasmic pigment. It has been proposed that NM initially plays a protective role by sequestering toxic catecholamine metabolites and heavy metals, but may become harmful during aging as it overwhelms cellular machinery and is released during neurodegeneration. Rodents do not naturally produce NM, limiting the study of causal relationships between NM and LC pathology. Adapting a viral-mediated approach for expression of human tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for peripheral melanin production, we successfully promoted pigmentation in mouse LC neurons that recapitulates key ultrastructural features of endogenous NM found in primates. Pigment expression results in LC neuron hyperactivity, reduced tissue NE levels, transcriptional changes, and novelty-induced anxiety phenotypes as early as 1-week post-injection. By 6-10 weeks, NM accumulation is associated with severe LC neuron neurodegeneration and microglial engulfment of the pigment granules, while the anxiety-like behavior is abated. These phenotypes are reminiscent of LC dysfunction and cell death in AD and PD, validating this model for studying the consequences of pigment accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "Genetic, molecular, and environmental factors influence diseases through complex interactions with genes, phenotypes, and drugs. Current methods often fail to integrate diverse multi-relational biological data meaningfully, limiting the discovery of novel risk genes and drugs. To address this, we present MedGraphNet, a multi-relational Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to infer relationships among drugs, genes, diseases, and phenotypes. MedGraphNet initializes nodes using informative embeddings from existing text knowledge, allowing for robust integration of various data types and improved generalizability. Our results demonstrate that MedGraphNet matches and often outperforms traditional single-relation approaches, particularly in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes. The model shows generalizability to external datasets, achieving high accuracy in identifying disease-gene associations and drug-phenotype relationships. Notably, MedGraphNet accurately inferred drug side effects without direct training on such data. Using Alzheimers disease as a case study, MedGraphNet successfully identified relevant phenotypes, genes, and drugs, corroborated by existing literature. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating multi-relational data with text knowledge to enhance biomedical predictions and drug repurposing for diseases.MedGraphNet code is available at https://github.com/vinash85/MedGraphNet",

      "abstract": "Understanding complex interactions in biomedical networks is crucial for advancements in biomedicine, but traditional link prediction (LP) methods are limited in capturing this complexity. Representation-based learning techniques improve prediction accuracy by mapping nodes to low-dimensional embeddings, yet they often struggle with interpretability and scalability. We present BioPathNet, a novel graph neural network framework based on the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), addressing these limitations through path-based reasoning for LP in biomedical knowledge graphs. Unlike node-embedding frameworks, BioPathNet learns representations between node pairs by considering all relations along paths, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability. This allows visualization of influential paths and facilitates biological validation. BioPathNet leverages a background regulatory graph (BRG) for enhanced message passing and uses stringent negative sampling to improve precision. In evaluations across various LP tasks, such as gene function annotation, drug-disease indication, synthetic lethality, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction prediction, BioPathNet consistently outperformed shallow node embedding methods, relational graph neural networks and task-specific state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robust performance and versatility. Our study predicts novel drug indications for diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Alzheimers, validated by medical experts and clinical trials. We also identified new synthetic lethality gene pairs and regulatory interactions involving lncRNAs and target genes, confirmed through literature reviews. BioPathNets interpretability will enable researchers to trace prediction paths and gain molecular insights, making it a valuable tool for drug discovery, personalized medicine and biology in general.",
