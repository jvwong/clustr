    "abstract": "Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). Here we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in human, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA subset of Alzheimer Disease patients carry mutant microglia somatic clones which promote neuro-inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss due to the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques and tau tangles in the brain; its onset and progression also depend on genetic factors such as the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Understanding how these factors affect the brains neural pathways is important for early diagnostics and interventions. Tractometry is an advanced technique for 3D quantitative assessment of white matter tracts, localizing microstructural abnormalities in diseased populations in vivo. In this work, we applied BUAN (Bundle Analytics) tractometry to 3D diffusion MRI data from 730 participants in ADNI3 (phase 3 of the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; age range: 55-95 years, 349M/381F, 214 with mild cognitive impairment, 69 with AD, and 447 cognitively healthy controls). Using along-tract statistical analysis, we assessed the localized impact of amyloid, tau, and APOE genetic variants on the brains neural pathways. BUAN quantifies microstructural properties of white matter tracts, supporting along-tract statistical analyses that identify factors associated with brain microstructure. We visualize the 3D profile of white matter tract associations with tau and amyloid burden in Alzheimers disease; strong associations near the cortex may support models of disease propagation along neural pathways. Relative to the neutral genotype, APOE{varepsilon} 3/{varepsilon}3, carriers of the AD-risk conferring APOE{varepsilon} 4 genotype show microstructural abnormalities, while carriers of the protective{varepsilon} 2 genotype also show subtle differences. Of all the microstructural metrics, mean diffusivity (MD) generally shows the strongest associations with AD pathology, followed by axial diffusivity (AxD) and radial diffusivity (RD), while fractional anisotropy (FA) is typically the least sensitive metric. Along-tract microstructural metrics are sensitive to tau and amyloid accumulation, showing the potential of diffusion MRI to track AD pathology and map its impact on neural pathways.",

    "abstract": "The entorhinal cortex (EC) is a critical brain area for memory formation, while also the region exhibiting the earliest histological and functional alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The EC thus has been long hypothesized as one of the originating brain areas of AD pathophysiology, although circuit mechanisms causing its selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. We found that dopamine neurons projecting their axons to the lateral EC (LEC), critical for memory formation in healthy brains, become dysfunctional and cause memory impairments in early AD brains. In amyloid precursor protein knock-in mice with associative memory impairment, LEC dopamine activity and associative memory encoding of LEC layer 2/3 neurons were disrupted in parallel from the early pathological stage. Optogenetic reactivation of LEC dopamine fibers, as well as L-DOPA treatment, rescued associative learning behavior. These results suggest that dysfunction of LEC-projecting dopamine neurons underlies memory impairment in AD from early stages, pointing to a need for clinical investigation of LEC dopamine in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "The perforant path (PP) carries direct inputs from entorhinal cortex to CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), with an impact dependent on PN position across transverse (CA1a-CA1c) and radial (superficial/deep) axes. It remains unclear how aging and Alzheimer disease (AD) affect PP input, despite its critical role in memory and early AD. Applying ex vivo recordings and two-photon microscopy in slices from mice up to 30 months old, we interrogated PP responses across PN subpopulations and compared them to Schaffer collateral and intrinsic excitability changes. We found that aging uniquely impacts PP excitatory responses, abolishing transverse and radial differences via a mechanism independent of presynaptic and membrane excitability change. This is amplified in aged 3xTg-AD mice, with further weakening of PP inputs to CA1a superficial PNs associated with distal dendritic spine loss. This demonstrates a unique feature of aging-related circuit dysfunction, with mechanistic implications related to memory impairment and synaptic vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Tight regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ is essential for neuronal bioenergetics and cellular metabolism. Ca2+ transfer from ER-localized ryanodine receptors (RyR) and inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) to the mitochondria maintains a steady Ca2+ source that fuels oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), RyR-evoked Ca2+ release is markedly increased, contributing to synaptic deficits, protein mishandling, and memory impairment. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulated RyR-Ca2+ release directly compromises mitochondrial activity and is an early contributor to AD cellular pathology. We measured an array of mitochondrial functions using fluorescent biosensors and optical imaging in RyR2-expressing HEK cells and iPSC-derived neurons from familial AD and nonAD patients. In neurons from AD patients, resting mitochondrial Ca2+ levels were elevated alongside increased free radical production and higher caspase-3 activity relative to nonAD neurons. RyR-evoked Ca2+ release further potentiated pathogenic mitochondrial responses in AD neurons, with increased Ca2+ uptake and exaggerated membrane depolarization. Additionally, clearance of damaged mitochondria was impaired in AD neurons, demonstrating consequences from dysfunctional lysosomes. Notably, impairments to mitochondria in AD neurons were largely prevented with the RyR negative allosteric modulator, Ryanodex. These findings highlight how excess RyR-Ca2+ release broadly contributes to early cellular pathology in AD which includes a cascade of ER, lysosomal, and mitochondrial deficits culminating in neuronal decline and degeneration. Additionally, pharmacological suppression of RyR-Ca2+ release preserves mitochondrial, ER and lysosomal function, thus providing a novel and effective therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Recent evidence suggests that disturbances of sleep architecture are linked to Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) pathology. Here, we assessed the association between sleep architecture and regional amyloid and tau pathology employing a portable sleep-monitoring device in addition to PET imaging. Methods: 18 cognitively normal adults (CN; M(Age) = 64.06 (8.63), Sex (M/F) =6/12) and 18 patients with MCI/early AD (M(Age) = 67.33 (8.25), Sex (M/F) =9/9) were included from the \\'Tau Propagation Over Time\\' (T-POT) study. All subjects underwent amyloid ([11C]-PiB) and tau ([18F]-AV1451) PET imaging. PET images were normalized to MNI-space and intensity standardized to the whole cerebellum ([11C]-PiB) or the inferior cerebellum ([18F]-AV1451). Sleep monitoring was performed at home using the portable \\'Dreem\\' EEG-headband (Beacon Biosignal), which is a reliable and comfortable wireless alternative to the gold-standard polysomnography (PSG). Sleep recordings were performed within six months of the PET acquisitions. At least, one sufficient night had to be acquired, which was used to assess the sleep macrostructure for each individual. Total duration of sleep phases per minutes (i.e. REM, N1, N2, N3) and total sleep time were extracted. In a first step, a linear mixed model (LMM) was used to compare the groups in terms of duration of the different sleep stages across the nightly recordings. Given the results of this comparison, mean N1 and N3 duration were subsequently correlated with regional amyloid and tau pathology SUVRs of 34 cortical regions using Spearman\\'s correlation. The reported results are based on one-tailed tests. All analyses were corrected for age. Results: Patients with MCI/AD showed reduced N3 duration (p = .007) compared to the CN group. A trend was observed indicating that patients with MCI/AD exhibited longer N1 durations (p = .094); however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Shorter N3 duration was associated with higher regional amyloid load in the paracentral lobe and the posterior cingulate gyrus, whereas longer N1 duration was linked to higher amyloid pathology in several regions, including the medial temporal lobe, cingulate cortex and the occipital lobe. Moreover, associations were observed between longer N1 duration and greater tau burden in regions comprising the temporal lobe, cingulate cortex, and medial-frontal areas of the brain. Conclusion: Differences in sleep architecture between healthy controls and MCI/AD may arise from regionally-specific accumulation patterns of AD pathologies. Although it remains unknown whether disruptions in sleep architecture are a cause or a consequence, a complex relationship between AD-aggregation pathology in specific brain regions and the different phases of sleep appears to emerge.",

Imaging and electrophysiological studies have revealed retinal alterations across several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. However, it remains largely unclear whether primary disease mechanisms within the retina contribute to the observed retinal alterations and which specific retinal cell types and biological mechanisms are involved.\n\nObjectiveTo determine whether specific retinal cell types are affected by genomic risk for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and to explore the mechanisms through which genomic risk converges in these cell types.\n\nDesign, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this study, we combined findings from genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and stroke with retinal single-cell transcriptomic data sets from humans, macaques, and mice. To identify susceptible cell types, we applied MAGMA cell type enrichment analyses and performed subsequent pathway analyses. Furthermore, we translated the cellular top hit to the structural level by using retinal optical coherence tomography and genotyping data in the large population-based UK Biobank cohort (n = 36,349).\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresCell type-specific enrichment of genetic risk loading for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorder traits in the gene expression profiles of retinal cells.\n\nResultsAmacrine cells (interneurons within the retina) were robustly enriched in schizophrenia genetic risk across mammalian species and in different developmental stages. This enrichment was primarily driven by genes involved in synapse biology. On the structural level, higher polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with thinning of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, which contains dendrites and synaptic connections of amacrine cells. Moreover, retinal immune cell populations were enriched in multiple sclerosis genetic risk. No consistent cell type associations were found for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, or stroke.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceThis study provides novel insights into the cellular underpinnings of retinal alterations in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and highlights the retina as a potential proxy to study synaptic pathology in schizophrenia.",

Simultaneous propagation of A{beta} aggregates from very limited to wide and distant brain regions is one of the outstanding events in the early stage. Here, we demonstrate that the neurovascular unit4,5 comprising capillaries and pericytes, the machinery supplying oxygen and glucose to neurons, is also the machinery for propagating effector molecules that impose Alzheimers pathologies on intact neurons. We discovered two distinct signaling cascades, one activated in capillary endothelial cells and the other in pericytes. At the origin of either cascade, we identified amylospheroid (ASPD)6,7, a highly toxic 30-mer assembly of A{beta}, and its sole target NKA38, a neuron-specific isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase9,10 but present in endothelial cells and pericytes. In endothelial cells, ASPD binding to NKA3 releases angiotensin II, which increases {beta}-secretase in intact neurons, causing a huge increase of A{beta}42and resultant accumulation. In pericytes, ASPD binding to NKA3 releases an unknown effector molecule that activates {delta}-secretase in intact neurons, further augmenting A{beta}42and producing pathogenic tau1-368 fragment. Thus, A{beta} and tau pathologies are directly linked. Stopping the signaling cascades near the origin by inhibiting ASPD-NKA3 interaction8 may provide a new therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimers disease (AD), the formation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) leads to neuronal loss in entorhinal cortex (EC), a crucial brain region for memory and navigation. These pathological changes are concurrent with the onset of memory impairments in AD patients with symptoms of forgetfulness such as misplacing items, disorientation in familiar environments etc. The lateral EC (LEC) is associated with non-spatial memory processing including object recognition. Since some LEC neurons fire in response to objects (object cells) while others fire at locations previously occupied by objects (trace cells), pathology in this region could lead to dysfunction in object-location coding. In this paper we show that a transgenic AD mouse model, EC-App/Tau, which expresses both APP and tau primarily in the EC region, have deficits in LEC-specific memory tasks. Using in vivo single-unit electrophysiology recordings we show that LEC neurons are hyperactive with low information content and high sparsity compared to the controls indicating poor firing fidelity. We finally show that object cells and trace cells fire less precisely in the EC-App/Tau mice compared to controls indicating poor encoding of objects. Overall, we show that AD pathology causes erratic firing of LEC neurons and object coding defects leading to LEC-specific memory impairment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile previous research has shown the potential links between taste perception pathways and brain-related conditions, the area involving Alzheimers disease remains incompletely understood. Taste perception involves neurotransmitter signaling, including serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine. Disruptions in these pathways are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. The integration of olfactory and taste signals in flavor perception may impact brain health, evident in olfactory dysfunction as an early symptom in neurodegenerative conditions. Shared immune response and inflammatory pathways may contribute to the association between altered taste perception and conditions like neurodegeneration, present in Alzheimers disease.\n\nMethodsThis study consists of an exploration of expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL), utilizing whole-blood transcriptome profiles, of 28 taste perception genes, from a combined cohort of 475 African American subjects. This comprehensive dataset was subsequently intersected with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of Alzheimers Disease (AD). Finally, the investigation delved into assessing the association between eQTLs reported in GWAS of AD and the profiles of 741 proteins from the Olink Neurological Panel.\n\nResultsThe eQTL analysis unveiled 3,547 statistically significant SNP-Gene associations, involving 412 distinct SNPs that spanned all 28 taste genes. In 17 GWAS studies encompassing various traits, a total of 14 SNPs associated with 12 genes were identified, with three SNPs consistently linked to Alzheimers disease across four GWAS studies. All three SNPs demonstrated significant associations with the down-regulation of TAS2R41, and two of them were additionally associated with the down-regulation of TAS2R60. In the subsequent pQTL analysis, two of the SNPs linked to TAS2R41 and TAS2R60 genes (rs117771145 and rs10228407) were correlated with the upregulation of two proteins, namely EPHB6 and ADGRB3.\n\nConclusionsOur investigation introduces a new perspective to the understanding of Alzheimers disease, emphasizing the significance of bitter taste receptor genes in its pathogenesis. These discoveries set the stage for subsequent research to delve into these receptors as promising avenues for both intervention and diagnosis. Nevertheless, the translation of these genetic insights into clinical practice requires a more profound understanding of the implicated pathways and their pertinence to the diseases progression across diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceWhile the hallmark pathologies of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau in Alzheimers disease (AD) are well documented and even part of the definition, upstream neuroinflammation is thought to play an important role but remains poorly understood.\n\nObjectivesWe tested whether two distinct neuroinflammatory markers are associated with cerebrovascular injury and A{beta}, and whether these markers are associated with plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau) concentration, medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortical and hippocampal atrophy, and memory deficits. We examined neuroinflammatory markers plasma YKL-40 and GFAP, due to previous conflicting evidence relating YKL-40 and GFAP to AD pathogenic markers.\n\nDesignCross-sectional data from a community observational study (Biomarker Exploration in Aging, Cognition, and Neurodegeneration - BEACoN) were included.\n\nSettingAll participants were enrolled in a single site, at University of California, Irvine.\n\nParticipants126 participants were included if they had at least one of the following measures available: neuropsychological data, MRI, A{beta}-PET, or plasma.\n\nExposuresPlasma YKL-40 and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels.\n\nMain outcomes and measuresWhite matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, 18F-florbetapir (FBP) PET mean SUVR, plasma phosphorylated tau (pTau-217) concentration, MTL cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, and memory function assessed by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Using path analysis, we tested whether higher plasma YKL-40 and GFAP are associated with WMH and A{beta}, and whether these converge to downstream markers of tauopathy, MTL neurodegeneration, and memory deficits.\n\nResultsIn older adults without dementia (N=126, age=70.60+6.29, 62% women), we found that higher plasma YKL-40 concentration was associated with greater WMH volume, while higher plasma GFAP concentration was related to increased FBP SUVR. Further, higher plasma GFAP, WMH and FBP SUVR were independently associated with increased pTau-217. In turn, plasma pTau-217 was associated with reduced MTL cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. Subsequently, only reduced hippocampal volume was related to lower memory function.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceNeuroinflammatory markers contribute to parallel pathways of cerebrovascular injury and A{beta}, which converge to tau-associated neurodegeneration and memory deficits in older adults. These observations underscore the need for a more comprehensive approach to developing an AD framework and treatment strategies.\n\nKEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow does neuroinflammation impact downstream features of cerebrovascular injury and amyloid-beta (A{beta}) in Alzheimers disease?\n\nFindingsIn this study of 126 older adults without dementia, we found evidence for two distinct neuroinflammatory pathways that lead to neurodegeneration and memory deficits. One path involves plasma YKL-40 and its impact on cerebrovascular injury, as measured by white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI scans. The other involves plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and its impact on A{beta} deposition measured via 18F-florbetapir (FBP) PET. Both pathways converged on tauopathy, measured by plasma pTau-217, which was associated with lower medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortical thickness and hippocampal volume, and consequently, memory deficits.\n\nMeaningInflammation acts on Alzheimers disease mechanisms via multiple distinct and parallel pathways which converge downstream onto neurodegeneration.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/616579v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d3c39org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ccc453org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d40bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b543cb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Credit: BioRender was used to help create this graphical abstract.",

    "abstract": "Missense mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) cause early-onset familial Alzheimers disease (FAD) and alter proteolytic production of secreted 38-to-43-residue amyloid {beta}-peptides (A{beta}) by the PSEN1-containing {gamma}-secretase complex, ostensibly supporting the amyloid hypothesis of pathogenesis. However, proteolysis of APP substrate by {gamma}-secretase is processive, involving initial endoproteolysis to produce long A{beta} peptides of 48 or 49 residues followed by carboxypeptidase trimming in mostly tripeptide increments. We recently reported evidence that FAD mutations in APP and PSEN1 cause deficiencies in early steps in processive proteolysis of APP substrate C99 and that this results from stalled {gamma}-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes. These stalled complexes triggered synaptic degeneration in a C. elegans model of FAD independently of A{beta} production. Here we conducted full quantitative analysis of all proteolytic events on APP substrate by {gamma}-secretase with six additional PSEN1 FAD mutations and found that all six are deficient in multiple processing steps. However, only one of these (F386S) was deficient in certain trimming steps but not in endoproteolysis. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in intact cells revealed that all six PSEN1 FAD mutations lead to stalled {gamma}-secretase enzyme-substrate/intermediate complexes. The F386S mutation, however, does so only in A{beta}-rich regions of the cells, not in C99-rich regions, consistent with the deficiencies of this mutant enzyme only in trimming of A{beta} intermediates. These findings provide further evidence that FAD mutations lead stalled and stabilized {gamma}-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes and are consistent with the stalled process rather than the products of {gamma}-secretase proteolysis as the pathogenic trigger.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge, with BACE1, a critical therapeutic target due to its role in the amyloidogenic pathway. This study presents an innovative approach to drug development by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to identify the potential BACE1 inhibitors. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of protein-ligand interactions, the current study employed a machine learning model to generate novel ligands with high binding affinity and specificity for the BACE1 active site. The models efficacy was validated through molecular docking studies, which demonstrated superior binding affinities compared to existing FDA-approved inhibitors such as Atabecestat and Lanabecestat. The findings reveal that the top candidate, MLC10, exhibits a unique mechanism of action by promoting controlled flexibility in BACE1, contrasting with the rigid conformations induced by traditional inhibitors. This dynamic modulation enhances the enzymes inhibition, suggesting a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, solvent-accessible surface area analyses indicate that MLC10 facilitates a more favourable protein conformation, potentially altering catalytic behaviour through increased solvent interactions. This work underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in drug discovery, paving the way for the development of next-generation BACE1 inhibitors. By harnessing computational techniques, the present work aims to address the limitations of current therapies and contribute to more effective treatments for Alzheimers disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the major cause of senile dementia without effective therapeutic strategies. The fundamental role of microglia in AD pathology, particularly in the early stages, is well acknowledged, although cell-specific therapeutic targets were not identified. Here we show that microglial connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels controls microglial reactivity in AD, thus being a promising therapeutic target. We discovered a marked increase in Cx43 protein in the periplaque microglia in the post-mortem tissue from AD patients. Subsequently, using the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that microglial Cx43 operating as hemichannels influences microglial function, which in turn affects {beta}-amyloid pathology. Ablation of microglial Cx43 hemichannels by genetic knockout shifted microglia to neuroprotective phenotype, which promoted the microglia-plaque interaction while suppressing the neurotoxic microglial signature, thereby mitigating the progression of AD. Following this lead, we developed a novel formulation of a small molecule peptide, lipid nanoparticle-delivered molecule TAT-Cx43266-283 (TAT-CX43@LNPs), which selectively blocks Cx43 hemichannels. Our preclinical trial demonstrated its efficacy in delaying and rescuing {beta}-amyloid-related neuropathology and cognitive impairment in AD mice. This study provides strong evidence to progress our novel drug into clinical trials and translate it to disease-preventing (when administered in the early disease stages) and disease-modifying agents.",

However, primed iPSCs can retain cell-of-origin epigenomic marks, especially those linked to heterochromatin and lamina-associated regions. Here we show that iPSCs produced from dermal fibroblasts of late-onset sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD) cases retain epigenomic anomalies that supersede developmental defects and neurodegeneration. When compared to iPSCs from elderly controls, AD iPSCs show reduced BMI1 expression, lower H3K9me3 levels, and an altered DNA methylome. Gene Ontology analysis of differentially methylated DNA regions (DMRs) reveals terms linked to cell-cell adhesion and synapse, with the cognitive resilience-associated MEF2 family of transcription factors being the most enriched at DMRs. Upon noggin exposure, AD iPSCs show lesser efficient neural induction and forebrain specification, together with increased ZIC2, ZIC5 and WNT-related gene expression. Long-term AD neuronal cultures present a dedifferentiation and loss-of-cell identity phenotype. Despite these epigenomic anomalies, AD iPSCs generate cortical neurons in normal proportion and readily form cerebral organoids developing amyloid and Tau pathology. BMI1 overexpression in AD neurons mitigates amyloid and tau accumulation, heterochromatin fragmentation, and G4 DNA induction. These findings implicate reprogramming resistant epigenomic anomalies or uncharacterized genetic alterations working in trans on the epigenome in AD pathophysiology.",

Statistical analyses employed Pearson correlation and Bootstrap methods, with p-values < 0.05 or 0.01 considered significant.

    "abstract": "In Alzheimers disease (AD), changes in the brain transcriptome are hypothesized to mediate the impact of neuropathology on cognition. Gene expression profiling from postmortem brain tissue is a promising approach to identify causal pathways; however, there are challenges to definitively resolve the upstream pathologic triggers along with the downstream consequences for AD clinical manifestations. We have functionally dissected 30 AD-associated gene coexpression modules using a cross-species strategy in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) models. Integrating longitudinal RNA-sequencing and behavioral phenotyping, we interrogated the unique and shared transcriptional responses to amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and/or aging, along with potential links to progressive neuronal dysfunction. Our results highlight hundreds of conserved, differentially expressed genes mapping to human AD regulatory networks. To confirm causal modules and pinpoint AD network drivers, we performed systematic in vivo genetic manipulations of 357 conserved, prioritized targets, identifying 141 modifiers of A{beta}- and/or tau-induced neurodegeneration. We discover an up-regulated network that is significantly enriched for both AD risk variants and markers of immunity / inflammation, and which promotes A{beta} and tau-mediated neurodegeneration based on fly genetic manipulations in neurons. By contrast, a synaptic regulatory network is strongly downregulated in human brains with AD and is enriched for loss-of-function suppressors of A{beta}/tau in Drosophila. Additional experiments suggest that this human brain transcriptional module may respond to and modulate A{beta}-induced glutamatergic hyperactivation injury. In sum, our cross-species, systems genetic approach establishes a putative causal chain linking AD pathology, large-scale gene expression perturbations, and ultimately, neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Impaired memory formation and recall is a distinguishing feature of Alzheimers disease, and memory requires de novo gene transcription in neurons. Rapid and robust transcription of many genes is facilitated by the formation of a poised basal state, in which RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) has initiated transcription, but is paused just downstream of the gene promoter. Neuronal depolarization releases the paused RNAP2 to complete the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Paused RNAP2 release is controlled by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is sequestered into a larger inactive complex containing Hexamethylene bisacetamide inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) under basal conditions. In this work, we find that neuronal expression of HEXIM1 mRNA is highly correlated with human Alzheimers disease pathologies. Furthermore, P-TEFb regulation by HEXIM1 has a significant impact on the rapid induction of neuronal gene transcription, particularly in response to repeated depolarization. These data indicate that HEXIM1/P-TEFb has an important role in inducible gene transcription in neurons, and for setting and resetting the poised state that allows for the robust activation of genes necessary for synaptic plasticity.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=183 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/615234v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1549237org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b84a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f17ebdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7c46c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the progressive loss of neuronal tissue, and the accumulation of amyloid fibrils. Currently, there are no therapeutics that remove these amyloids. Targeted protein degradation could be a promising strategy to remove fibrils or oligomeric precursors. This approach requires degraders that specifically recognise amyloid fibrils, preferentially in early stages. Here, we introduce FibrilPaint20 (FP20), a peptide that specifically mediates the ubiquitination of amyloid fibrils. It acts as a PROTAC, containing both of a fibril recognition module and a recruitment motif for the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Importantly, FP20 does not bind to the functional monomer but exclusively to fibrils. Remarkably, FP20 ubiquitinates a set chemically diverse fibrils, unrelated in sequence and morphology. This includes fibrils of the disease-related proteins of -synuclein, A{beta}, Huntingtin and various Tau species, such as patient-derived fibrils from Alzheimer, Frontotemporal Dementia and Corticobasal Degeneration. This makes FP20 interesting for targeting mixed pathologies. Together, FP20 is an attractive lead compound for targeted protein degradation of amyloid fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of pathological tau isoforms, especially hyperphosphorylated tau at serine 396 (pS396-tau) and tau oligomers, has been demonstrated in the retinas of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD). Previous studies have noted a decrease in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in AD patients, but the presence and impact of pathological tau isoforms in RGCs and RGC integrity, particularly in early AD stages, have not been explored. To investigate this, we examined retinal superior temporal cross-sections from 25 patients with MCI (due to AD) or AD dementia and 16 cognitively normal (CN) controls, matched for age and gender. We utilized the RGC marker ribonucleic acid binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) and Nissl staining to assess neuronal density in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Our study found that hypertrophic RGCs containing pS396-tau and T22-positive tau oligomers were more frequently observed in MCI and AD patients compared to CN subjects. Quantitative analyses indicated a decline in RGC integrity, with 46-55% and 55-56% reductions of RBPMS+ RGCs (P<0.01) and Nissl+ GCL neurons (P<0.01-0.001), respectively, in MCI and AD patients. This decrease in RGC count was accompanied by increases in necroptotic-like morphology and the cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic marker in RGCs of AD patients. Furthermore, there was a 2.1 to 3.1-fold increase (P<0.05-0.0001) in pS396-tau-laden RGCs in MCI and AD patients, with a greater abundance observed in individuals with higher Braak stages (V-VI), more severe clinical dementia ratings (CDR=3), and lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores. Strong correlations were noted between the decline in RGCs and the total amount of retinal pS396-tau and pS396-tau+ RGCs, with pS396-tau+ RGC counts correlating significantly with brain neurofibrillary tangle scores (r= 0.71, P= 0.0001), Braak stage (r= 0.65, P= 0.0009), and MMSE scores (r= -0.76, P= 0.0004). These findings suggest that retinal tauopathy, characterized by pS396-tau and oligomeric tau in hypertrophic RGCs, is associated with and may contribute to RGC degeneration in AD. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore noninvasive retinal imaging techniques that target tau pathology in RGCs to improve AD detection and monitor disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are widely expressed in the brain; however, their precise roles in neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimers disease (AD) remain elusive. Bioinformatic analysis of the published single-cell RNA-seq data collected from AD patient cohorts indicates that the Trpc3 gene is uniquely upregulated in excitatory neurons. TRPC3 expression is also upregulated in post-mortem AD brains, and in both acute and chronic mouse models of AD. Functional screening of TRPC3 antagonists resulted in a lead inhibitor JW-65, which completely rescued A{beta}-induced neurotoxicity, impaired synaptic plasticity (e.g., LTP), and learning memory in acute and chronic experimental AD models. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we found that treatment with soluble {beta}-amyloid oligomers (A{beta}Os) induces rapid and sustained upregulation of the TRPC3 expression selectively in excitatory neurons. This aberrantly upregulated TRPC3 contributes to A{beta}Os-induced Ca2+ overload through the calcium entry and store-release mechanisms. The neuroprotective action of JW-65 is primarily mediated via restoring A{beta}Os-impaired Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signaling pathways, including calmodulin kinases CaMKII/IV and calcineurin (CaN). The synaptic protective mechanism via TRPC3 inhibition was further supported by hippocampal RNA-seq data from the symptomatic 5xFAD mice after chronic treatment with JW-65. Overall, these findings not only validate TRPC3 as a novel therapeutic target for treating synaptic dysfunction of AD but most importantly, disclose a distinct role of upregulated TRPC3 in AD pathogenesis in mediating Ca2+ dyshomeostasis.",

While therapeutic platforms targeting TDP-43 have predominantly targeted its aggregation, recent findings suggest that loss of functional TDP-43 dimers and multimers - essential for RNA processing - occur upstream of aggregation and is driven through disruption of N-terminal domain (NTD) interactions. Here, we demonstrate that these interactions are targetable via cellular fluorescence lifetime-based FRET biosensors which we used to screen the FDA-approved Selleck library. Our NTD-specific hit ketoconazole rescues sorbitol-induced TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation, and ameliorates TDP-43 induced downregulation of SREBP2, a TDP-43 mRNA binding target with known implication in ALS. In addition, ketoconazole improves neurite outgrowth in a TDP-43 overexpressing neuron model and motor dysfunction in TDP-43 overexpressing C. elegans. Taken together, our platform represents a novel approach for targeting NTD-dependent TDP-43 interactions, and the identification of ketoconazole validates an exciting translational premise for TDP-43 drug discovery.",

We analyzed human brain proteomics and found consistent elevations of all CP proteins, but not other complement pathways, in AD patient brains. We performed human genetics analysis that identified a rare variant in the C1S gene within the Finnish population that is associated with AD and we found that a common AD-associated C1S variant correlates with increased C1S protein levels. A targeted assay detected elevated C1S activation in AD patient CSF. Given this specific implication of the CP in AD, we next evaluated the therapeutic approach of targeting the CP in the brain using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). To identify promising CP targets for knockdown using ASOs we first tested for rescue of synapse loss in an AD mouse model using heterozygous and homozygous complement knockout mice and examined the relative brain expression levels of different CP genes. Based on these experiments we prioritized C1r, C1s and C4 as promising targets for therapeutic knockdown using ASOs. We then screened for ASOs for each target, evaluating in vitro and in vivo knockdown and toxicity, and identified optimal ASOs targeting C1r, C1s and C4. Experiments with AD model mice demonstrated significant rescue of synapse loss following treatment with C1r, C1s or C4 ASOs. Overall, our findings provide proof of concept for using nucleic acid-based medicine to target the CP in AD and demonstrate the translational potential of this approach.",

The APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model is widely used to study the pathology of AD. Although previous research has established AD-associated impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these cognitive dysfunctions remain less understood. To address this gap, we investigated the activities of place cells in both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subregions, which have distinct yet complementary computational roles. Behaviorally, APP/PS1 mice demonstrated impaired spatial recognition memory compared to wild-type (WT) mice in the object location test. Physiologically, place cells in APP/PS1 mice showed deterioration in spatial representation compared to WT. Specifically, CA1 place cells exhibited significant reductions in coherence and spatial information, while CA3 place cells displayed a significant reduction in place field size. Both CA1 and CA3 place cells in APP/PS1 mice also showed significant disruptions in their ability to stably encode the same environment. Furthermore, the burst firing properties of these cells were altered to forms correlated with reduced cognition. Additionally, the theta rhythm was significantly attenuated in CA1 place cells of APP/PS1 mice compared to WT. Our results suggest that distinct alteration in the physiological properties of CA1 and CA3 place cells, coupled with disrupted hippocampal theta rhythm in CA1, may collectively contribute to impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in AD.",

While rsEEG revealed global neural slowing and disrupted synchrony, these measures reflected widespread changes in brain neurophysiology without network-specific insights. In contrast, TMS-EEG identified network-specific local hyper-excitability in the parietal DMN and disrupted connectivity with frontal DMN regions, which uniquely predicted distinct cognitive impairments and mediated the link between structural brain integrity and cognition. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how network-specific neurophysiological disruptions contribute to AD-related cognitive dysfunction.

Its dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD), contributing to the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques. We propose an AD therapeutic strategy targeting the BBB low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). We show that a multivalent scaffold with LRP1-specific peptide modulates the A{beta} transport at the BBB. We show via detailed experimentation on AD model mice that this intervention markedly reduces A{beta} deposits and prevents cognitive decline. This study marks a new approach to drug design, combining multivalent targeting with the regulation of membrane trafficking through advanced molecular engineering. Crucially, the therapeutic effects emerge from the multivalent nature of our proposed system.

However, it is unclear how A{beta} plaques interact with surrounding glial cells in the human brain. Here, we applied spatial transcriptomics (ST) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for A{beta}, GFAP, and IBA1 to acquire data from 258,987 ST spots within 78 postmortem brain sections of 21 individuals. By coupling ST and adjacent-section IHC, we showed that low A{beta} spots exhibit transcriptomic profiles indicative of greater neuronal loss than high A{beta} spots, and high-glia spots present transcriptomic changes indicative of more significant inflammation and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we observed that this ST glial response bears signatures of reported mouse gene modules of plaque-induced genes (PIG), oligodendrocyte (OLIG) response, disease-associated microglia (DAM), and disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), as well as different microglia (MG) states identified in human AD brains, indicating that multiple glial cell states arise around plaques and contribute to local immune response. We then validated the observed effects of A{beta} on cell apoptosis and plaque-surrounding glia on inflammation and synaptic loss using IHC. In addition, transcriptomic changes of iPSC-derived microglia-like cells upon short-interval A{beta} treatment mimic the ST glial response and mirror the reported activated MG states. Our results demonstrate an exacerbation of synaptic and neuronal loss in low-A{beta} or high-glia areas, indicating that microglia response to A{beta}-oligomers likely initiates glial activation in plaque-glia niches.

PSEN1 is the catalytic subunit of {gamma}-secretase, responsible for regulated intramembrane proteolysis of numerous substrates that include cytokine receptors. For this reason, we tested the hypothesis that mutations in PSEN1 impact inflammatory responses in astrocytes, thereby contributing to disease progression.\n\nHere, using iPSC-astrocytes, we show that PSEN1 is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, and this upregulation is disrupted by pathological PSEN1 mutations. Using transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that PSEN1 mutant astrocytes have an augmented inflammatory profile in their basal state, concomitant with an upregulation of genes coding for regulated intramembrane proteolytic and robust activation of JAK-STAT signalling. Using JAK-STAT2 as an example signalling pathway, we show altered phosphorylation cascades in PSEN1 mutant astrocytes, reinforcing the notion of altered cytokine signalling cascades. Finally, we use small molecule modulators of {gamma}-secretase to confirm a role for PSEN1/{gamma}-secretase in regulating the astrocytic response to inflammatory stimuli.\n\nTogether, these data suggest that mutations in PSEN1 enhance cytokine signalling via impaired regulated intramembrane proteolysis, thereby predisposing astrocytic inflammatory profiles. These findings support a two-hit contribution of PSEN1 mutations to fAD pathogenesis, not only impacting APP and A{beta} processing but also altering the cellular response to inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play pivotal roles in various biological functions and are closely linked to many human diseases including cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Structural investigations of IDPs typically involve a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental data to correct for intrinsic biases in simulation methods. However, these simulations are hindered by their high computational cost and a scarcity of experimental data, severely limiting their applicability. Despite the recent advancements in structure prediction for structured proteins, understanding the conformational properties of IDPs remains challenging partly due to the poor conservation of disordered protein sequences and limited experimental characterization. Here, we introduce IDPFold, a method capable of generating conformational ensembles for IDPs directly from their sequences using fine-tuned diffusion models. IDPFold bypasses the need for Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) or experimental data, achieving accurate predictions of ensemble properties across numerous IDPs. By sampling conformations at the backbone level, IDPFold provides more detailed structural features and more precise property estimation compared to other state-of-the-art methods. IDPFold is ready to be used in the elucidate the sequence-disorder-function paradigm of IDPs.",

Emerging data in mice and humans highlight microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, as cellular mediators of synapse loss; however, the upstream modulators of microglia-synapse engulfment remain elusive. Here, we report a distinct subset of astrocytes, which are glial cells essential for maintaining synapse homeostasis, appearing in a region-specific manner with age and amyloidosis at onset of synapse loss. These astrocytes are distinguished by their peri-synaptic processes which are  bulbous in morphology, contain accumulated p62-immunoreactive bodies, and have reduced territorial domains, resulting in a decrease of astrocyte-synapse coverage. Using integrated in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that astrocytes upregulate and secrete phagocytic modulator, milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8), which is sufficient and necessary for promoting microglia-synapse engulfment in their local milieu. Finally, we show that knocking down Mfge8 specifically from astrocytes using a viral CRISPR-saCas9 system prevents microglia-synapse engulfment and ameliorates synapse loss in two independent amyloidosis mouse models of AD. Altogether, our findings highlight astrocyte-microglia crosstalk in determining synapse fate in amyloid models and nominate astrocytic MFGE8 as a potential target to ameliorate synapse loss during the earliest stages of AD.",

We show that distinct interventions, a medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)-enriched diet and a carbohydrate-free, high-fat diet (CFHF), improve cognition and dendritic spine density of memory-associated hippocampal neurons in two mouse models of Alzheimers disease (AD). Only the CFHF diet drove increased circulating ketones, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. AD mice exhibited baseline and diet-induced susceptibility to peripheral metabolic disturbances that were improved by MCT and exacerbated by CFHF diets. Prominent AD-associated dysregulation of the liver transcriptome was largely restored by both interventions, but MCT also downregulated lipogenic enzymes and did not trigger a CFHF-like inflammatory signature. Novel AD- and diet-induced plasmatic changes in hormones and lipid species were identified. Thus, different ketogenic interventions yield cognitive benefits in AD models while showing intervention-specific modulation of peripheral metabolic defects, with implications for design of therapeutic ketogenic strategies.",

They impair electrical conduction, disrupt neural circuits, and correlate with AD severity. Despite their significance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain unknown. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling proteomics approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human iPSC-derived AD model allowing mechanistic investigation of spheroid pathology and optical electrophysiology. This approach revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics, and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated within spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR levels in spheroids strongly correlated with AD severity in humans. Importantly, inhibition of mTOR in iPSC-derived neurons and in mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and novel targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "As the most common subtype of dementia, Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive functions, especially in memory, thinking, and reasoning ability. Early diagnosis and interventions enable the implementation of measures to reduce or slow further regression of the disease, preventing individuals from severe brain function decline. The current framework of AD diagnosis depends on A/T/(N) biomarkers detection from cerebrospinal fluid or brain imaging data, which is invasive and expensive during the data acquisition process. Moreover, the pathophysiological changes of AD accumulate in amino acids, metabolism, neuroinflammation, etc., resulting in heterogeneity in newly registered patients. Recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have found to be a non-invasive, efficient and less-costly alternative on AD screening. However, most of existing studies rely on single omics only. To address these concerns, we introduce WIMOAD, a weighted integration of multi-omics data for AD diagnosis. WIMOAD synergistically leverages specialized classifiers for patients paired gene expression and methylation data for multi-stage classification. The resulting scores were then stacked with MLP-based meta-models for performance improvement. The prediction results of two distinct meta-models were integrated with optimized weights for the final decision-making of the model, providing higher performance than using single omics only. Remarkably, WIMOAD achieves significantly higher performance than using single omics alone in the classification tasks. The models overall performance also outperformed most existing approaches, highlighting its ability to effectively discern intricate patterns in multi-omics data and their correlations with clinical diagnosis results. In addition, WIMOAD also stands out as a biologically interpretable model by leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to elucidate the contributions of each gene from each omics to the model output. We believe WIMOAD is a very promising tool for accurate AD diagnosis and effective biomarker discovery across different progression stages, which eventually will have consequential impacts on early treatment intervention and personalized therapy design on AD.",

First, cluster analysis was performed on individuals diagnosed with \"No Cognitive Impairment (NCI)\", \"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)\", and \"Alzheimers Disease (AD)\" stages in clinical trials using gene expression and epigenome data. NCI was found to contain at least two substages, whereas MCI and AD were found to contain four and six substages, respectively. An inference of adjacency networks among substages, evaluated via partition-based graph abstraction using the gene expression profiles of individuals, suggested the possibilities of multiple typical disease progression pathways from NCI through different MCI substages and then to different AD substages.

In the brain, TREM2 is expressed in microglia, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage, linked to AD risk, but the responsible protease in microglia is still unknown. Another microglia-expressed AD risk factor is catalytically inactive rhomboid 2 (iRhom2, RHBDF2), which binds to and acts as a non-catalytic subunit of the metalloprotease ADAM17. A potential role in TREM2 proteolysis is not yet known. Using microglial-like BV2 cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages and primary murine microglia, we identify iRhom2 as a modifier of ADAM17-mediated TREM2 shedding. Loss of iRhom2 increased TREM2 in cell lysates and at the cell surface and enhanced TREM2 signaling and microglial phagocytosis of the amyloid {beta}-peptide (A{beta}). This study establishes ADAM17 as a physiological TREM2 protease in microglia, and suggests iRhom2 as a potential drug target for modulating TREM2 proteolysis in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Early diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of definitive biomarkers and reliance on invasive procedures. Immune biomarkers, particularly those reflecting the interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral immune system, have shown promise for non-invasive detection through blood samples. This study investigates the reactivity of serum IgM and IgG from AD and FTD patients against a library of mimotopes representing public IgM reactivities in healthy donors. Serum samples from AD, FTD, and other neurodegenerative dementias (ND), and controls were tested on peptide microarrays. The samples were pooled to mitigate individual variability. The reactivity data were analyzed using graphs to represent the cross-reactivity networks. The analysis revealed distinct reactivity patterns for the studied groups. Public IgM reactivities showed significant correlations with neurodegenerative conditions, with AD and FTD exhibiting loss or gain of specific IgM reactivities. Graph analysis highlighted significant differences in graph density, clustering, and assortativity parameters between disease and control groups. Idiotypic reactivities, particularly in IgM, were more connected in healthy controls compared to those with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, clusters of reactivities showed significant distinctions between AD and FTD, with IgG reactivities providing additional differentiation. A number of self proteins related to neurodegeneration proved to have sequences homologous to disease associated mimotopes. Thus, the public IgM repertoire, characterized by its broad reactivity and inherent autoreactivity, offers valuable insights into the immunological alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. The study supports the potential of IgM and IgG reactivity profiles as another compartment of non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis and differentiation of AD and FTD.",

In this study, our goal was to investigate the protective functions of PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant in a less aggressive mouse model of AD as well as to assess the underlying mechanisms at the molecular and cellular level using mouse and human microglia models.\n\nMethodsThe effects of the protective PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant on microglia activation, AD-related {beta}-amyloid and neuronal pathologies, as well as behavioral changes were investigated in PLC{gamma}2-P522R knock-in mice crossbred with APP/PS1 AD model mice. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional studies were carried out in cultured and acutely isolated adult PLC{gamma}2-P522R mouse microglia to study molecular mechanisms. Finally, microglia-like cell models generated from blood and skin biopsy samples of the PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant carriers were employed to translate the key findings to human cells.\n\nResultsOur results demonstrate that the PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant reduced brain {beta}-amyloid plaque burden of APP/PS1 mice. Simultaneously, PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant increased non-proinflammatory microglia activation and microglia clustering around {beta}-amyloid plaques, leading to reduced {beta}-amyloid plaque-associated neuronal dystrophy. In cultured mouse primary microglia, PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant decreased accumulation of large lipid droplets, reduced cell stress, and increased acute response to strong inflammatory stimuli. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in acutely isolated adult mouse microglia as well as in human monocyte-derived microglial cells showed that PLC{gamma}2-P522R upregulates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and downregulates inflammatory/interferon signaling pathways. Accordingly, PLC{gamma}2-P522R increased mitochondrial respiration in iPSC-derived microglial cells.\n\nConclusionsTogether, these findings suggest that PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant exerts protection against AD-associated {beta}-amyloid and neuronal pathologies via enhancing microglial barrier formation around {beta}-amyloid plaques and suppressing pro-inflammatory activation. Observed changes in fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial flexibility as well as the downregulation of genes involved in inflammatory signaling pathways suggest that these protective effects of the PLC{gamma}2-P522R variant are mediated through an anti-ageing mechanism.",

Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). To define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in metabolic reprograming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of A{beta}. In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and when crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit increased levels of A{beta} plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin signaling in microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism, neuroinflammation and the ability of the cells to take up A{beta}, such that reduced insulin signaling in microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis.

Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce neurovirulence through microglial activation in the brains of patients and experimentally inoculated animals, which are models representative for moderate to severe respiratory disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the neuroinvasive and neurovirulent potential of SARS-CoV-2 in intranasally inoculated ferrets, a model for subclinical to mild respiratory disease. The presence of viral RNA, histological lesions, virus-infected cells, and the number and surface area of microglia and astrocytes were investigated. Viral RNA was detected in various respiratory tissue samples by qPCR at 7 days post inoculation (dpi). Virus antigen was detected in the nasal turbinates of ferrets sacrificed at 7 dpi and was associated with inflammation. Viral RNA was detected in the brains of ferrets sacrificed 7 dpi, but in situ hybridization nor immunohistochemistry did not verify evidence of infection. Histopathological analysis of the brains showed no evidence for an influx of inflammatory cells. Despite this, we observed an increased number of Alzheimer type II astrocytes in the hindbrains of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated ferrets. Additionally, we detected an increased microglial activation in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, and a decrease in the astrocytic activation status in the white matter and hippocampus of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated ferrets. In conclusion, although showed that SARS-CoV-2 has limited neuroinvasive potential in this model for subclinical to mild respiratory disease, there is evidence for neurovirulent potential. This study highlights the value of this ferret model to study the neuropathogenecity of SARS-CoV-2 and reveals that a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect both microglia and astrocytes in different parts of the brain.",

How abnormalities in this pathway lead to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD) have yet to be elucidated.

Extracellular field recordings in the infralimbic cortex at this age showed layer-specific reductions in response amplitude and paired-pulse ratio following activation of hippocampal input fibres, indicating changes to short-term hippocampal-prefrontal synaptic plasticity. Bulk RNA sequencing of the mPFC in 6-month-old mice identified differential gene expression changes associated with calcium ion transport, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission. Seven of these genes (Gpm6b, Slc38a5, Ccr5, Kcnj10, Ddah1, Gad1, Slc17a8) were also differentially expressed in 3-month mice. These results reveal a pre-clinical deficit in executive function correlating with synaptic plasticity and gene expression changes in the mPFC of male 3xTg mice.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to brain endothelial barrier dysfunction contribute to Alzheimers Disease (AD), which is characterized by beta-amyloid (A{beta}) accumulation in senile plaques. Copper (Cu) is implicated in AD pathology and its levels are tightly controlled by several Cu transport proteins. However, their expression and role in AD, particularly in relation to brain endothelial barrier function remains unclear. In this study, we examined the expression of Cu transport proteins in the brains of AD mouse models as well as their involvement in A{beta}42-induced brain endothelial barrier dysfunction. We found that the Cu uptake transporter CTR1 was upregulated, while the Cu exporter ATP7A and/or ATP7B were downregulated in the hippocampus of AD mouse models, and in A{beta}42-treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). In the 5xFAD AD mouse model, Cu levels (assessed by ICP-MS) were elevated in the hippocampus. Moreover, A{beta}42-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ROS-dependent loss in barrier function in hBMEC (measured by transendothelial electrical resistance), and tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin were all inhibited by either a membrane permeable Cu chelator or by knocking down CTR1 expression. These findings suggest that dysregulated expression of Cu transport proteins may lead to intracellular Cu accumulation in the AD brain, and that A{beta}42 promotes ROS-dependent brain endothelial barrier dysfunction and VE-Cadherin phosphorylation in a CTR1-Cu-dependent manner. Our study uncovers the critical role of Cu transport proteins in oxidative stress-related loss of BBB integrity in AD.\n\nHighlightsO_LIUpregulation of the Cu importer CTR1 and downregulation of the Cu exporter ATP7A in the hippocampus of AD mouse models\nC_LIO_LIA{beta}42 increases CTR1 expression while reduces ATP7A and ATP7B levels in human brain microvascular ECs.\nC_LIO_LIA{beta}42 triggers increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human brain microvascular ECs through a CTR1- and Cu-dependent manner.\nC_LIO_LIA{beta}42 induces endothelial barrier dysfunction in human brain microvascular ECs through a CTR1-Cu-ROS-pendent manner.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Characteristic cerebral pathological changes of Alzheimers disease (AD) such as glucose hypometabolism or the accumulation of cleavage products of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), known as A{beta} peptides, lead to sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neurodegeneration. To preserve ER homeostasis, cells activate their unfolded protein response (UPR). The rhomboid-like-protease 4 (RHBDL4) is an enzyme that participates in the UPR by targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation. We demonstrated previously that RHBLD4 cleaves APP in HEK293T cells, leading to decreased total APP and A{beta}. More recently, we showed that RHBDL4 processes APP in mouse primary mixed cortical cultures as well. Here, we aim to examine the physiological relevance of RHBDL4 in the brain. We first found that brain samples from AD patients and an AD mouse model (APPtg) showed increased RHBDL4 mRNA and protein expression. To determine the effects of RHBDL4s absence on APP physiology in vivo, we crossed APPtg mice to a RHBDL4 knockout (R4-/-) model. RHBDL4 deficiency in APPtg mice led to increased total cerebral APP and amyloidogenic processing when compared to APPtg controls. Contrary to expectations, as assessed by cognitive tests, RHBDL4 absence rescued cognition in 5-month-old female APPtg mice. Informed by unbiased RNAseq data, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that RHBDL4 absence leads to greater levels of active {beta}-catenin due to decreased proteasomal clearance. Decreased {beta}-catenin activity is known to underlie cognitive defects in APPtg mice and AD. Our work suggests that RHBDL4s increased expression in AD, in addition to regulating APP levels, leads to aberrant degradation of {beta}-catenin, contributing to cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease and Alzheimers Disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) pose major global healthcare challenges, with diabetes mellitus (DM) being a key risk factor. Both AD and DM-related ADRD are characterized by reduced cerebral blood flow, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We previously identified compromised cerebral hemodynamics as early signs in TgF344-AD and type 2 DM-ADRD (T2DN) rat models. Genome-wide studies have linked AD/ADRD to SNPs in soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). This study explored the effects of sEH inhibition with TPPU on cerebral vascular function and cognition in AD and DM-ADRD models. Chronic TPPU treatment improved cognition in both AD and DM-ADRD rats without affecting body weight. In DM-ADRD rats, TPPU reduced plasma glucose and HbA1C levels. Transcriptomic analysis of primary cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells from AD rats treated with TPPU revealed enhanced pathways related to cell contraction, alongside decreased oxidative stress and inflammation. Both AD and DM-ADRD rats exhibited impaired myogenic responses and autoregulation in the cerebral circulation, which were normalized with chronic sEH inhibition. Additionally, TPPU improved acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) of DM-ADRD rats. Acute TPPU administration unexpectedly caused vasoconstriction in the MCA of DM-ADRD rats at lower doses. In contrast, higher doses or longer durations were required to induce effective vasodilation at physiological perfusion pressure in both control and ADRD rats. Additionally, TPPU decreased reactive oxygen species production in cerebral vessels of AD and DM-ADRD rats. These findings provide novel evidence that chronic sEH inhibition can reverse cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairments in AD/ADRD, offering a promising avenue for therapeutic development.",

We report that TOMM40 is prone to transcription readthrough into APOE that can generate spliced TOMM40-APOE mRNA chimera (termed T9A2) detected in human neurons and other cells and tissues. T9A2 translation tethers APOE (normal APOE3 or APOE4) to near-full-length TOM40 that is targeted to mitochondria. Importantly, T9A2-APOE3 boosts mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity and decreases oxidative stress significantly more than T9A2-APOE4 and APOE3, and lacking in APOE4. We describe detailed interactomes of these actors that may inform about the activities and roles in pathogenesis.

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction underlies early sensorimotor and cognitive deficits, and precedes neurodegeneration in a variety of disorders, including Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington disease (HD). A monogenic inherited disorder, HD manifests with cognitive, motor and mood disorders associated with progressive degeneration of striatal spiny projection neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons. Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loops regulate movement selection and motor learning, which are impaired early in HD. Skilled motor learning is mediated in part by plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses, including endocannabinoid-mediated, high-frequency stimulation induced long-term depression (HFS-LTD). Previously, we found impaired HFS-LTD in brain slice recordings from pre-manifest HD mouse models, which was corrected by JZL184, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) degradation. Here, we tested the effects of JZL184 administered in vivo to YAC128 HD model and wild-type (WT) littermate mice. JZL184, given orally daily over a 3-week period, significantly increased levels of 2-AG in striatal tissue. While JZL184 treatment had no impact on open field behavior which was similar for the two genotypes, the treatment improved motor learning on the rotarod task in YAC128 mice to the level observed in WT mice. Moreover, HFS-induced striatal plasticity measured by field potential recording in acute brain slice from YAC128 mice was normalized to WT levels after JZL184 treatment. These results suggest a novel target for mitigating early symptoms of HD, and support the need for clinical trials to test the efficacy of modulating the endocannabinoid system in treatment of HD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) has become ubiquitous as the number of elderly individuals increases and has been conceived as a socioeconomic problem lately. To date, no success is recorded for disease-modifying therapies for AD but only drugs for symptomatic relief exist. Research has been centered on the role of {beta}-amyloid on the pathogenesis of AD, which has led to the development of drugs that target A{beta} ({beta} and {gamma}-Secretase inhibitors) to reduce the amount of A{beta} formed. However, the existing {beta} and {gamma}-Secretase inhibitors were associated with harmful side effects, low efficacy, and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, in this current study, 54 alkaloids from the PhytoHub server (phytohub.eu), and two approved drugs were docked against {beta}-Secretases. Additionally, galantamine and 5 alkaloids with the utmost binding potential with {beta}-secretase were subjected to pharmacokinetics evaluation and docked against {gamma}-secretase. . From our result, 5 compounds displayed for both docking periods, with demissidine, solasodine, tomatidine, and solanidine having better BE than the control drugs. Based on the Pharmacokinetics evaluation, 4 compounds possessed good pharmacokinetic evaluation and biological activities than galantamine. This study suggests that demissidine, solasodine, tomatidine, and solanidine are promising dual inhibitors against {beta} and {gamma}-Secretase proteins in silico. However, there is an urgent need to carry out in vitro and in vivo experiments on these new leads to validate the findings of this study.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) is a widely recognized geroprotective intervention that slows or prevents Alzheimers disease (AD) in animal models. CR is typically implemented via feeding mice a single meal per day; as CR mice rapidly consume their food, they are subject to a prolonged fast between meals. While CR has been shown to improve metabolic and cognitive functions and suppress pathological markers in AD mouse models, the specific contributions of fasting versus calorie reduction remains unclear. Here, we investigated the contribution of fasting and energy restriction to the beneficial effects of CR on AD progression. To test this, we placed 6-month-old 3xTg mice on one of several diet regimens, allowing us to dissect the effects of calories and fasting on metabolism, AD pathology, and cognition. We find that energy restriction alone, without fasting, was sufficient to improve glucose tolerance and reduce adiposity in both sexes, and to reduce A{beta} plaques and improve aspects of cognitive performance in females. However, we find that a prolonged fast between meals is necessary for many of the benefits of CR, including improved insulin sensitivity, reduced phosphorylation of tau, decreased neuroinflammation, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, and activation of autophagy, as well as for the full cognitive benefits of CR. Finally, we find that fasting is essential for the benefits of CR on survival in male 3xTg mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that fasting is required for the full benefits of a CR diet on the development and progression of AD in 3xTg mice, and suggest that both when and how much we eat influences the development and progress of AD.",

    "abstract": "Microglia respond to Alzheimers disease (AD) with a variety of transcriptional responses. However, the regulation of specific transcriptional signatures and the contribution of each individual response to disease progression is only starting to be characterized. We have previously shown that hypoxia via hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a strong regulator of A{beta} plaque-associated microglia (A{beta}AM). Here, we characterize the role of HIF1-mediated transcription of Egln3, encoding for PHD3, in A{beta}AM. We show that oligomeric A{beta} treatment (oA{beta}) in vitro induces the expression of Hif1a and Egln3 in microglia, which correlates with the transcriptional activation of genes involved in the interferon type I signature (IFNS) in a PHD3-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we demonstrate FOXO3 to be an important repressor of IFNS in microglia, whose abundance decreases upon A{beta} presence, and, correspondingly, both in human single-nucleus (sn) and mouse A{beta}AM transcriptomics, FOXO3 DNA binding sites define the IFNS. FOXO3 repression of the IFNS is dependent on PHD3, with our results suggesting a physical interaction between both proteins in vitro. In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlate with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature (DAM) in A{beta}AM. Transcriptional changes in microglia associate with increased microglia proximity to A{beta} plaques, augmented phagocytosis of A{beta} by microglia, reduced parenchymal levels of A{beta}, and an increase in small-sized plaques. PHD3 deficiency also reduced the A{beta} plaque-associated neuropathology and rescued behavioural deficits of an AD mouse model. Finally, we also demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression during development in the absence of A{beta} pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and to behavioural alterations. Altogether, our data strongly indicate that the PHD3-FOXO3 axis controls the microglial IFNS in a cell autonomous manner, contributing to the progression of AD.",

These neural deficits align with behavioral inflexibility in dynamic threat scenarios.

    "abstract": "Pooling MRI data from multiple datasets requires harmonization to reduce undesired inter-site variabilities, while preserving effects of biological variables (or covariates). The popular harmonization approach ComBat uses a mixed effect regression framework that explicitly accounts for covariate distribution differences across datasets. There is also significant interest in developing harmonization approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs), such as conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE). However, current DNN approaches do not explicitly account for covariate distribution differences across datasets. Here, we provide mathematical results, suggesting that not accounting for covariates can lead to suboptimal harmonization. We propose two DNN-based covariate-aware harmonization approaches: covariate VAE (coVAE) and DeepResBat. The coVAE approach is a natural extension of cVAE by concatenating covariates and site information with site- and covariate-invariant latent representations. DeepResBat adopts a residual framework inspired by ComBat. DeepResBat first removes the effects of covariates with nonlinear regression trees, followed by eliminating site differences with cVAE. Finally, covariate effects are added back to the harmonized residuals. Using three datasets from three continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10085 anatomical T1 scans, we find that DeepResBat and coVAE outperformed ComBat, CovBat and cVAE in terms of removing dataset differences, while enhancing biological effects of interest. However, coVAE hallucinates spurious associations between anatomical MRI and covariates even when no association exists. Future studies proposing DNN-based harmonization approaches should be aware of this false positive pitfall. Overall, our results suggest that DeepResBat is an effective deep learning alternative to ComBat.

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by a significant loss of neurons and synapses in cognitive brain regions and is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. AD pathology comprises extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. However, the triggers of this pathology are still poorly understood. Repressor element 1-silencing transcription/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF), a transcription repressor of neuronal genes, is dysregulated during AD pathogenesis. How REST is dysregulated is still poorly understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of short non-coding RNAs, typically regulate protein expression by interacting with target mRNA transcript 3-untranslated region (UTR) and play essential roles in AD pathogenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-153-3p reduces REST 3-UTR activities, mRNA, and protein levels in human cell lines, along with downregulating amyloid-{beta} precursor protein (APP) and -synuclein (SNCA). We determine by mutational analyses that miR-153-3p interacts with specific targets via the seed sequence present within the respective mRNA 3UTR. We show that miR-153-3p treatment alters the expression of these specific proteins in human neuronally differentiated cell lines and human induced pluripotent stem cells and that miR-153-3p is itself dysregulated in AD. We further find that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 5kb of the MIR153-1 and MIR153-2 genes are associated with AD-related endophenotypes. Elevation of miR-153-3p is associated with a reduced probability of AD, while elevated REST may associate with a greater probability of AD. Our work suggests that a supplement of miR-153-3p would reduce levels of toxic protein aggregates by reduced expression of APP, SNCA and REST expression, all pointing towards a therapeutic and biomarker potential of miR-153-3p in AD and related dementias.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunctional autophagy is a primary characteristic of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. How autophagic impairment leads to cellular changes that contributes to AD pathogenesis remains unclear. To study this further, we assessed levels of autophagy related proteins in 5xFAD mice brain at different ages and found their robust upregulation in cortex and hippocampus suggesting increased induction of autophagy with disease progression but failed clearance. We have identified a transcriptional coregulator Sertad1, as a key mediator of dysfunctional autophagy in AD mice. We found a progressive elevation in Sertad1 levels in 5xFAD mice with age compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Sertad1 knockdown in 5xFAD mice brain lowered levels of autophagy related proteins and lysosome marker, LAMP1 suggesting its role in autophagy flux modulation. FoxO3a is an important transcriptional regulator of the autophagy network and lies at the nexus of autophagy-apoptosis cross-talk. We found that Sertad1 knockdown blocked nuclear translocation of FoxO3a along with a restoration in Akt activity. Further, we showed that knockdown of Sertad1 in 5xFAD mice brain improved cognitive functions along with a remarkable restoration in synaptic health and dendritic spine density. Taken together, our results demonstrated that autophagy is robustly induced with disease progression but it is impaired; Sertad1 knockdown restored autophagy defects, synaptic loss and improved learning and memory in AD models. Thus, we propose that Sertad1 acts in a multimodal manner regulating crucial cell death pathways including apoptosis and autophagy and could be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention to combat a multifactorial disorder such as AD.",

To address this problem, by hypothesing that the early disease sAD states can be characterised by transcriptomic fingerprints, we assessed the effect on A{beta} aggregation in human neuroblastoma cells a set of genes obtained by analysing snRNA-seq data from post-mortem AD patients. We then validated the most effective genes in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons, and selected FBXO2, a gene encoding a subunit of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex SCF, for further analysis. We found that early downregulation of FBXO2 in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons resulted in A{beta} aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and structural and functional neuronal network impairment. Based on these results, we report a neuronal sAD model (FBXO2 KD sAD) that recapitulates a set of molecular hallmarks of sAD.

Current ADs diagnosis involves biomarkers assays in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as A{beta} to validate the diagnosis. However, these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and can result in inaccurate diagnoses by not accounting for differential diagnose. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring new technologies for detecting AD biomarkers in biological fluids, though progress is hindered by an incomplete understanding of AD mechanisms and CSF composition. In this study, we used a standardized microfluidic platform to investigate the effects of synthetic A{beta} peptides and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD and healthy patients on neuronal functional activity. First, human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were characterized. Then, to modulate the functional activity of neurons, tetrodotoxin (TTX), a specific sodium channel blocker, was used as a control for inhibiting neuronal activity. Subsequently, glutamatergic neurons were chronically exposed to A{beta}O and patients CSF. MEA recordings were performed before and after the treatments to assess changes in network activity. Our results demonstrated that extracting key electrophysiological metrics allows for discrimination between healthy and AD CSF samples.

Accurate detection of NFTs in tissue samples can reveal relationships with clinical, demographic, and genetic features through deep phenotyping. However, expert manual analysis is time-consuming, subject to observer variability, and cannot handle the data amounts generated by modern imaging. We present a scalable, open-source, deep-learning approach to quantify NFT burden in digital whole slide images (WSIs) of post-mortem human brain tissue. To achieve this, we developed a method to generate detailed NFT boundaries directly from single-point-per-NFT annotations. We then trained a semantic segmentation model on 45 annotated 2400{micro}m by 1200{micro}m regions of interest (ROIs) selected from 15 unique temporal cortex WSIs of AD cases from three institutions (University of California (UC)-Davis, UC-San Diego, and Columbia University).

We compared this to deep object detection, which achieved comparable but coarser-grained performance that was 60% faster.

There is still more to be learned about the impact of enhancing global protein O-GlcNAcylation, which is important for understanding the mechanistic path of using OGA inhibition to treat AD. In this study, we investigated the acute effect of pharmacologically increasing O-GlcNAc levels, using OGA inhibitor Thiamet G (TG), on normal mouse brains. We hypothesized that the transcritome signature in respones to TG treatment provides a comprehensive view of the effect of OGA inhibition. We sacrificed the mice and dissected their brains after 3 hours of saline or 50 mg/kg TG treatment, and then performed mRNA sequencing using NovaSeq PE 150 (n=5 each group). We identified 1,234 significant differentially expressed genes with TG versus saline treatment. Functional enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes identified several upregulated pathways, including genes normally down in AD. Among the downregulated pathways were the cell adhesion pathway as well as genes normally up in AD and aging. When comparing acute to chronic TG treatment, protein autophosphorylation and kinase activity pathways were upregulated, whereas cell adhesion and astrocyte markers were downregulated in both datasets. Interestingly, mitochondrial genes and genes normally down in AD were up in acute treatment and down in chronic treatment. Data from this analysis will enable the evaluation of the mechanisms underlying the potential benefits of OGA inhibition in the treatment of AD. In particular, although OGA inhibitors are promising to treat AD, their downstream chronic effects related to bioenergetics may be a limiting factor.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=185 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/613769v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@178dcf6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f2cc78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14dfe28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16918aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe pathological effects of amyloid {beta} oligomers (A{beta}o) may be mediated through the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), leading to synaptic loss in Alzheimers disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of mGluR5 using [18F]FPEB indicate a reduction of receptor binding that is focused in the medial temporal lobe in AD. Synaptic loss due to AD measured through synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) quantification with [11C]UCB-J PET is also focused in the medial temporal lobe, but with clear widespread reductions is commonly AD-affected neocortical regions. In this study, we used [18F]FPEB and [11C]UCB-J PET to investigate the relationship between mGluR5 and synaptic density in early AD.\n\nMethodsFifteen amyloid positive participants with early AD and 12 amyloid negative, cognitively normal (CN) participants underwent PET scans with both [18F]FPEB to measure mGluR5 and [11C]UCB-J to measure synaptic density. Parametric DVR images using equilibrium methods were generated from dynamic. For [18F]FPEB PET, DVR was calculated using equilibrium methods and a cerebellum reference region. For [11C]UCB-J PET, DVR was calculated with a simplified reference tissue model - 2 and a whole cerebellum reference region.\n\nResultA strong positive correlation between mGluR5 and synaptic density was present in the hippocampus for participants with AD (r = 0.81, p < 0.001) and in the CN group (r = 0.74, p = 0.005). In the entorhinal cortex, there was a strong positive correlation between mGluR5 and synaptic in the AD group (r = 0.85, p <0.001), but a weaker non-significant correlation in the CN group (r = 0.36, p = 0.245). Exploratory analyses within and between other brain regions suggested significant positive correlations between mGluR5 in the medial temporal lobe and synaptic density in a broader set of commonly AD-affected regions.\n\nConclusionMedial temporal loss of mGluR5 in AD is associated with synaptic loss in both medial temporal regions and more broadly in association cortical regions, indicating that mGluR5 mediated A{beta}o toxicity may lead to early synaptic loss more broadly in AD-affected networks. In CN individuals, an isolated strong association between lower mGluR5 and lower synaptic density may indicate non-AD related synaptic loss.",

Only a small fraction of biomarkers discovered so far by proteomic analysis reaches clinical trials. Here, we presented a machine learning-based workflow for proteomics data analysis, which partially solves some of these issues. In particular, we used a customized decision tree model, which was regulated using a newly introduced parameter, min_cohorts_leaf, that resulted in better generalization of trained models. Further, we analyzed the trend of feature importances curve as a function of min_cohorts_leaf parameter and found that it could be used for accurate feature selection to obtain a list of proteins with significantly improved generalization. Finally, we demonstrated that the recently introduced DirectMS1 search algorithm for protein identification and quantitation provides a simple, yet, a highly efficient solution for the problem of combining multiple data sets obtained using different experimental settings. The developed workflow was tested using five published LC-MS/MS data sets obtained in the large consortia studies of Alzheimers disease brain samples. The selected data sets consist of 535 files in total analyzed using label-free single-shot data-dependent or data-independent acquisitions. Using the proposed modified ExtraTrees model we found that the expressions of two proteins involved in ferroptosis Serotransferrin TRFE and DNA repair nuclease/redox regulator APEX1, are important for explaining a lack of dementia for patients with the presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.",

However, the window of opportunity for successful sleep-targeted interventions regarding reduction of pathological hallmarks and related cognitive performance remains poorly characterized. Here, we enhanced slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep via sodium oxybate (SO) oral administration for 2 weeks at early (6 months old) or moderately late (11 months old) disease stages in Tg2576 mice, and evaluated resulting neuropathology and behavioral performance. We observed that cognitive performance of 6 months old Tg2576 mice significantly improved upon SO treatment, whereas no change was observed in 11 months old mice. Histochemical assessment of amyloid plaques demonstrated that SO-treated 11 months old Tg2576 mice had significantly less plaque burden than placebo-treated ones, whereas ELISA of insoluble protein fractions from 6 months old Tg2576 mice brains indicated lower A{beta}-42/A{beta}-40 ratio in SO-treated group vs. placebo-treated controls. Altogether, our results suggest that SWA-dependent reduction of brain amyloidosis leads to alleviated behavioral impairment in Tg2576 mice only if administered early in the disease course, potentially highlighting the key importance of early sleep-based interventions in clinical cohorts.\n\nSignificance statementA staggering amount of people worldwide live with AD. Despite extensive efforts from academy and industry, no cure is available to date. Sleep may be a modifiable factor involved in onset, progression and potentially also treatment of AD. However, knowledge regarding important aspects of sleep-targeted treatments is missing, e.g. adequate window of opportunity for their efficacious application, their minimal duration or their effect onto both pathology and cognition. We found that pharmacologically enhanced sleep depth is associated with reduced amyloid neuropathology in AD mice brains at both early- and moderately advanced-stage disease. However, only early-stage disease mice significantly benefited from sleep-enhancing treatment. Our results strongly encourage further mechanistic research and the launch of larger scale preclinical investigations in early AD populations.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known cause and cure. Research suggests that a reduction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons activity in the hippocampus by beta-amyloid peptide (A{beta}) is a crucial trigger for cognitive impairment in AD via hyperexcitability. Therefore, enhancing hippocampal inhibition is thought to be protective against AD. However, hippocampal inhibitory cells are highly diverse, and these distinct interneuron subtypes differentially regulate hippocampal inhibitory circuits and cognitive processes. Moreover, A{beta} unlikely affects all subtypes of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus equally. Hence, identifying the affected interneuron subtypes in AD to enhance hippocampal inhibition optimally is conceptually and practically challenging. We have previously found that A{beta} selectively binds to two of the three major hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes, 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs, but not 3{beta}4-nAChRs, and inhibits these two receptors in cultured hippocampal inhibitory interneurons to decrease their activity, leading to hyperexcitation and synaptic dysfunction in excitatory neurons. We have also revealed that co-activation of 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs is required to reverse the A{beta}-induced adverse effects in hippocampal excitatory neurons. Here, we discover that 7- and 4{beta}2-nAChRs predominantly control the nicotinic cholinergic signaling and neuronal activity in hippocampal parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) inhibitory interneurons, respectively. Furthermore, we reveal that co-activation of these receptors is necessary to reverse hippocampal network dysfunction and fear memory loss in the amyloid pathology model mice. We thus suggest that co-activation of PV+ and SST+ cells is a novel strategy to reverse hippocampal dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD.",

    "abstract": "Late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) research has principally focused on neurons over the years due to their known role in the production of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In contrast, recent genomic studies of LOAD have implicated microglia as culprits of the prolonged inflammation exacerbating the neurodegeneration observed in patient brains. Indeed, recent LOAD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported multiple loci near genes related to microglial function, including TREM2, ABI3, and CR1. However, GWAS alone cannot pinpoint underlying causal variants or effector genes at such loci, as most signals reside in non-coding regions of the genome and could presumably confer their influence frequently via long-range regulatory interactions. We elected to carry out a combination of ATAC-seq and high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C in two human microglial cell models (iPSC-derived microglia and HMC3) in order to physically map interactions between LOAD GWAS-implicated candidate causal variants and their corresponding putative effector genes. Notably, we observed consistent evidence that rs6024870 at the GWAS CASS4 locus contacted the promoter of nearby gene, RTFDC1. We subsequently observed a directionallly consistent decrease in RTFDC1 expression with the the protective minor A allele of rs6024870 via both luciferase assays in HMC3 cells and expression studies in primary human microglia. Through CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of the putative regulatory region harboring rs6024870 in HMC3 cells, we observed increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and decreased DNA double strand break repair related, at least in part, to RTFDC1 expression levels. Our variant-to-function approach therefore reveals that the rs6024870-harboring regulatory element at the LOAD  CASS4 GWAS locus influences both microglial inflammatory capacity and DNA damage resolution, along with cumulative evidence implicating RTFDC1 as a novel candidate effector gene.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a transcriptional network of Alzheimers disease (AD) risk genes that are primarily expressed in microglia and are associated with AD pathology. However, traditional short-read sequencers have limited our ability to fully characterize how GWAS variants exert their effects on gene expression regulation or alternative splicing in response to the pathology, particularly resulting in inaccurate detection of splicing. To address this gap, we utilized long-read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in the AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model to identify changes in splicing and novel transcript isoforms in response to amyloid-{beta}. We show that long-read RNA-seq can recapitulate the expected induction of microglial expressed risk genes such as Trem2 in response to amyloid-{beta} at 9 months of age associated with ageing-dependent deficiencies in spatial short-term memory in the AppNL-G-F knock-in mice. Our results not only identified novel splicing events and transcript isoform abundance in genes associated with AD, but also revealed the complex regulation of gene expression through splicing in response to amyloid plaques. Surprisingly, the regulation of alternative splicing in response to amyloid was seen in genes previously not identified as AD risk genes, expressed in microglia, neurons and oligodendrocytes, and included genes such as Syngr1 that modulate synaptic physiology. We saw alternative splicing in genes such as Ctsa, Clta, Dennd2a, Irf9 and Smad4 in mice in response to amyloid, and the orthologues of these genes also showed transcript usage changes in human AD brains. Our data suggests a model whereby induction of AD risk gene expression associated with microglial proliferation and activation is concomitant with alternative splicing in a different class of genes expressed by microglia and neurons, which act to adapt or preserve synaptic activity in response to amyloid-{beta} during early stages of the disease. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms and effects of the regulation of genes associated with amyloid pathology, which may ultimately enable better disease diagnosis, and improved tracking of disease progression. Additionally, our findings identify new therapeutic avenues for treatment of AD.",

All [18F]AV-1451 PETs were intensity-standardized (reference: inferior cerebellum), z-transformed (control sample: 147 amyloid-negative subjects) and subsequently thresholded (z-score > 1.96) and converted to volume-maps. Based on these volume-maps, tau-changes over time were assessed in terms of 1) tau-speed (i.e. newly affected volume at follow-up), and 2) tau-level-rise (i.e. tau increase in previously affected volume). These two measures were entered as dependent variables in separate linear mixed effects models including four baseline risk factors (BMI, education, hypertension, neuropsychiatric symptom severity), baseline amyloid, tau-volume or tau burden, ApoE4 status, clinical stage, sex, and age as predictors. Next, we tested the interactive effects between baseline amyloid or tau burden with the four modifiable factors on either tau-speed or tau-level-rise, respectively.\n\nResultsFaster tau-speed was linked to higher BMI, female sex, ApoE4-status, and baseline tau-volume. The effect of baseline tau-volume on tau-speed was driven by greater global amyloid burden. In terms of tau-level-rise, we observed that lower hypertension and BMI were linked to a slower increase in tau burden. A load-dependent effect of baseline amyloid and tau burden was found. Higher amyloid and BMI as well as lower education and higher tau burden were linked to greater tau-level-rise.\n\nConclusionEducation, BMI and hypertension differentially influence tau speed and level rise by its interaction with initial pathological burden. Timely modification of these factors may overall slow taus progression.",

    "abstract": "A pervasive dilemma in neuroimaging is whether to prioritize sample size or scan time given fixed resources. Here, we systematically investigate this trade-off in the context of brain-wide association studies (BWAS) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We find that total scan duration (sample size x scan time per participant) robustly explains individual-level phenotypic prediction accuracy via a logarithmic model, suggesting that sample size and scan time are broadly interchangeable up to 20-30 min of data. However, the returns of scan time diminish relative to sample size, which we explain with principled theoretical derivations. When accounting for fixed overhead costs associated with each participant (e.g., recruitment, non-imaging measures), prediction accuracy in many small-scale and some large-scale BWAS might benefit from longer scan time than typically assumed. These results generalize across phenotypic domains, scanners, acquisition protocols, racial groups, mental disorders, age groups, as well as resting-state and task-state functional connectivity. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of scan time, which is ignored in standard power calculations. Standard power calculations maximize sample size, at the expense of scan time, which can result in sub-optimal prediction accuracies and inefficient use of resources.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Although traditional methods have provided insights into brain dynamics in AD, they have limitations in capturing non-equilibrium dynamics across disease stages. Recent studies suggest that dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state networks (RSNs) may serve as a biomarker for AD, but the role of deviations from dynamical equilibrium remains underexplored.\n\nOBJECTIVEThis study applies the off-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT)1 to analyze brain dynamics in AD, aiming to compare deviations from equilibrium in healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and those with AD. The goal is to identify potential biomarkers for early AD detection and understand disease progressions mechanisms.\n\nMETHODSWe employed a model-free approach based on FDT to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, including healthy controls, MCI patients, and AD patients. Deviations from equilibrium in resting-state brain activity were quantified using fMRI scans. In addition, we performed model-based simulations incorporating Amyloid-Beta (A{beta}), tau burdens, and Generative Effective Connectivity (GEC) for each subject.\n\nRESULTSOur findings show that deviations from equilibrium increase during the MCI stage, indicating hyperexcitability, followed by a significant decline in later stages of AD, reflecting neuronal damage. Model-based simulations incorporating A{beta} and tau burdens closely replicated these dynamics, especially in AD patients, highlighting their role in disease progression. Healthy controls exhibited lower deviations, while AD patients showed the most significant disruptions in brain dynamics.\n\nDISCUSSIONThe study demonstrates that the off-equilibrium FDT framework can accurately characterize brain dynamics in AD, providing a potential biomarker for early detection. The increase in non-equilibrium deviations during the MCI stage followed by their decline in AD offers a mechanistic explanation for disease progression. Future research should explore how combining this framework with other dynamic brain measures could further refine diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and glial activation. Asrij/OCIAD1 (Ovarian Carcinoma Immunoreactive Antigen Domain containing protein 1) is an AD-associated factor. Increased Asrij levels in the brains of AD patients and mouse models are linked to the severity of neurodegeneration. However, the contribution of Asrij to AD progression and whether reducing Asrij levels is sufficient to mitigate A{beta} pathology in vivo is unclear.\n\nMethodsTo explore the impact of Asrij on AD pathology, we deleted asrij in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD and analyzed the effects on AD hallmarks. We used the Morris water maze and open field test to assess behavioral performance. Using immunohistochemistry and biochemical analyses, we evaluated A{beta} plaque load, neuronal and synaptic damage, and gliosis. Further, we utilized confocal microscopy imaging, flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analysis to comprehensively investigate changes in microglial responses to A{beta} pathology upon Asrij depletion.\n\nResultsAsrij depletion ameliorates cognitive impairments, A{beta} deposition, neuronal and synaptic damage, and reactive astrogliosis in the AD mouse. Notably, Asrij-deficient microglia exhibit reduced plaque-associated proliferation and decreased phagocytic activation. Transcriptomic analyses of AD microglia reveal upregulation of energy metabolism pathways and downregulation of innate immunity and inflammatory pathways upon Asrij depletion. Mechanistically, loss of Asrij increases mitochondrial activity and impedes the acquisition of a pro-inflammatory disease-associated microglia (DAM) state. Reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased STAT3 and NF-{kappa}B activation indicate protective changes in AD microglia. Taken together, our results suggest that increased Asrij levels reported in AD, may suppress microglial metabolic activity and promote inflammatory microglial activation, thereby exacerbating AD pathology.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, we show that Asrij depletion ameliorates A{beta} pathology, neuronal and synaptic damage, gliosis, and improves behavioral performance in APP/PS1 mice. This supports that Asrij exacerbates the AD pathology. Mechanistically, Asrij is critical for the development of DAM and promotes neuroinflammatory signaling activation in microglia, thus restricting neuroprotective microglial responses. Hence, reducing Asrij in this context may help retard AD. Our work positions Asrij as a critical molecular regulator that links microglial dysfunction to AD pathogenesis.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/608066v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@119ae27org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8c3a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f3b7f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b17805_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSINTRODUCTIONC_ST_ABSAlzheimers disease (AD) patients are at greater risk of focal seizures than similarly aged adults; these seizures, left untreated, may worsen functional decline. Older people with epilepsy generally respond well to antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, whether specific ASMs can differentially control seizures in AD is unknown. The corneal kindled mouse model of acquired chronic secondarily generalized focal seizures allows for precisely timed drug administration studies to quantify the efficacy and tolerability of ASMs in an AD-associated genetic model. We hypothesized that mechanistically distinct ASMs would exert differential anticonvulsant activity and tolerability in aged AD mice (8-15 months) to define whether rational ASM selection may benefit specific AD genotypes.\n\nMETHODSAged male and female PSEN2-N141I versus age-matched non-transgenic control (PSEN2 control) C57Bl/6J mice, and APPswe/PS1dE9 versus transgene negative (APP control) littermates underwent corneal kindling to quantify latency to fully kindled criterion. Dose-related ASM efficacy was then compared in each AD model versus matched control over 1-2 months using ASMs commonly prescribed in older adults with epilepsy: valproic acid, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and gabapentin.\n\nRESULTSSex and AD genotype differentially impacted seizure susceptibility. Male PSEN2-N141I mice required more stimulations to attain kindling criterion (X2=5.521; p<0.05). Male APP/PS1 mice did not differ in kindling rate versus APP control mice, but they did have more severe seizures. There were significant ASM class-specific differences in acute seizure control and dose-related tolerability. APP/PS1 mice were more sensitive than APP controls to valproic acid, levetiracetam, and gabapentin. PSEN2-N141I mice were more sensitive than PSEN2 controls to valproic acid and lamotrigine.\n\nDISCUSSIONAD genotypes may differentially impact ASMs activity and tolerability in vivo with advanced biological age. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of seizure risk in AD and suggest that precisely selected ASMs may beneficially control seizures in AD, thus reducing functional decline.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of two types of protein aggregates, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which strongly contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Senile plaques consist primarily of aggregated amyloid-{beta}, while neurofibrillary tangles form via aggregation of the protein Tau, as well as other microtubule-associated proteins such as CRMP2. Posttranslational modifications have been hypothesized to contribute to the initial aggregation events that lead to SPs and NFTs. Dehydroamino acids (DHAAs) are posttranslational modifications rarely observed in humans and have not previously been reported in AD. DHAAs arise from the eliminylation of serine, threonine, or cysteine, yielding a double bond with distinct molecular geometry and reactivity. Their geometry can produce secondary structure rearrangements, such as those seen in senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, while their reactivity can cause intramolecular or intermolecular (protein-protein) crosslinking. We hypothesized that this modification might be present in protein aggregation-associated neurodegenerative disorders like AD.\n\nMethodsWe performed mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics on the sarkosyl-insoluble (protein aggregate-enriched) material from ten AD brains and three age-matched controls. Identifications of DHAA-mediated crosslinked peptides were validated using both an isotopic labeling strategy and spike-in experiments employing synthetic crosslinked peptide standards. Similar findings were obtained in searches of publicly available proteomic datasets from AD and control brains.\n\nResultsWe identified 412 sites of DHAA modification in 184 proteins, with the highest prevalence in the neurofibrillary tangle-forming proteins Tau and CRMP2. Comparison with results of previous protein aggregate interactomics studies show that proteins containing the DHAA modification are more highly associated with protein aggregates than are proteins containing any other individual posttranslational modification. We further observed 11 protein crosslinks arising from DHAAs, including three from the Tau protein. Label free quantification showed that Tau crosslinks are an order of magnitude more prevalent in AD samples than in age-matched controls.\n\nConclusionsDehydroamino acids and their derivatives are prevalent modifications in the Alzheimers disease brain proteome. These modifications give rise to protein crosslinks which may contribute to protein aggregation processes.",

Whether receptor transport remains intact in Alzheimers disease is still a major open question. Here, we investigated whether apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease, altered intracellular transport in human brain endothelial cells. To achieve this, we first developed an optimized protocol for induced pluripotent stem cells based on a defined chemical cocktail and extracellular-matrix support to differentiate brain endothelial cells (iCE-BECs). Multi-omic profiling and functional transport assays showed that iCE-BECs have a brain endothelial gene signature and recapitulate receptor-mediated transcytosis of a clinically validated BrainshuttleTM antibody against transferrin receptor. Engineered iCE-BECs homozygous for ApoE4 had altered spatiotemporal organization of early endosomes, increased transferrin receptor expression and reduced cytoplasmic iron. Our data revealed that ApoE4 can impact intracellular transport and iron homeostasis at the BBB in a cell-autonomous manner.

In addition, we show that our proposal is able to discover critical interactions in the Alzheimers disease. Our findings highlight the potential of GNNs in predicting phenotypes and discovering the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "NMDAR antagonists, such as memantine and ketamine, have shown efficacy in treating neurodegenerative diseases and major depression. The mechanism by which these drugs correct the aforementioned diseases is still unknown. Our study reveals that these antagonists significantly enhance 20S proteasome activity, crucial for degrading intrinsically disordered, oxidatively damaged, or misfolded proteins, factors pivotal in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. In a mouse model, ketamine administration notably altered brain synaptic protein profiles within two hours, downregulating proteins linked to neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, the altered proteins exhibited enrichment in terms related to plasticity and potentiation, including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling--a pivotal pathway in both short- and long-term plasticity that may elucidate the long-lasting effects of ketamine in major depression. Via the ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome pathway (UIPS), these drugs maintain cellular protein homeostasis, crucial as proteasome activity declines with age leading to protein aggregation and disease symptoms. The elucidation of the mechanistic pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of NMDAR antagonists holds promise for developing new treatment strategies for brain diseases, including schizophrenia, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) forms aggregates in the Alzheimers disease brain and is well known for its pathological roles. Recent studies show that it also regulates neuronal physiology in the healthy brain. Whether A{beta} also regulates glial physiology in the normal brain, however, has remained unclear. In this article, we describe the discovery of a novel signaling pathway activated by the monomeric form of A{beta} in vitro that plays essential roles in the regulation of microglial activity and the assembly of neocortex during development in vivo. We find that activation of this pathway depends on the function of amyloid precursor (APP) and the heterotrimeric G protein regulator Ric8a in microglia and inhibits microglial immune activation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Genetic disruption of this pathway during neocortical development results in microglial dysregulation and excessive matrix proteinase activation, leading to basement membrane degradation, neuronal ectopia, and laminar disruption. These results uncover a previously unknown function of A{beta} as a negative regulator of brain microglia and substantially elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Considering the prominence of A{beta} and neuroinflammation in the pathology of Alzheimers disease, they also highlight a potentially overlooked role of A{beta} monomer depletion in the development of the disease.",

However, cell type-specific contributions to epigenetic dysregulation in disease are unclear as studies have often used bulk brain tissue. Therefore, methods for the deconvolution of bulk H3K27ac profiles are critical. Here we developed the Cell type-specific Histone Acetylation Score (CHAS), a computational tool for inferring cell type-specific signatures in bulk brain H3K27ac profiles. We applied CHAS to > 300 H3K27ac ChIP-seq samples from studies of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder in bulk post-mortem brain tissue. In addition to recapitulating known disease-associated shifts in cellular proportions, we identified novel cell type-specific biological insights into brain disorder associated regulatory variation. In most cases, genetic risk and epigenetic dysregulation targeted different cell types, thus suggesting independent mechanisms. For instance, Alzheimers disease genetic risk was exclusively enriched within microglia, while epigenetic dysregulation predominantly fell within oligodendrocyte-specific H3K27ac regions. In addition, reanalysis of the original datasets using CHAS enabled identification of biological pathways associated with each neurological and psychiatric disorder at cellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell omics has proven to be a powerful instrument for exploring cellular diversity. With advances in sequencing protocols, single-cell studies are now routinely collected from large-scale donor cohorts consisting of samples from hundreds of donors with the goal of uncovering the molecular bases of higher-level donor phenotypes of interest. For example, to better understand the mechanisms behind Alzheimers disease, recent studies with up to hundreds of samples have investigated the relationships between single-cell omics measurements and donors neuropathological phenotypes (e.g. Braak staging) [4, 9, 3, 10].\n\nIn order to ensure the robustness of such findings, it may be desirable to aggregate data from multiple distinct donor cohorts. Unfortunately, doing so is not always straightforward, as different cohorts may be equipped with different sets of phenotype labels. Continuing the previous Alzheimers example, recent AD study cohorts have provided various subsets of neuropathological phenotypes, cognitive testing results, and APOE genotype. Thus, it is desirable to be able to infer any missing phenotype labels such that all available cell-level data in the study of a given phenotype of interest could be used. Moreover, beyond simply imputing missing phenotype information, it is often of interest to understand which groups of cells and/or molecular features may be most predictive of a given phenotype of interest. As such, there is a pressing need for computational methods that can connect cell-level measurements with donor-level labels.\n\nHowever, accomplishing this task is not straightforward. While a rich literature exists on learning meaningful low-dimensional representations of cells [7, 8, 1, 2] and for inferring corresponding cell-level labels (e.g. cell type) [11], the donor level prediction task introduces substantial additional complexity. For example, different numbers of cells may be recovered from each donor, and thus our prediction model must be able to handle arbitrary numbers of samples as input. Moreover, ideally our model would not a priori require any additional prior knowledge beyond our cell-level measurements, such as the importance of different cell types for a given prediction task.\n\nTo resolve these issues, here we propose milVI (multiple instance learning variational inference), a deep generative modeling framework that explicitly accounts for donor-level phenotypes and enables inference of missing phenotype labels post-training. In order to handle varying numbers of cells per donor when inferring phenotype labels, milVI leverages recent advances in multiple instance learning. We validated milVI by applying to impute held-out Braak staging information from an Alzheimers disease study cohort from Mathys et al. [9], and we found that our method achieved lower error on this task compared to naive imputation methods.",

However, brain amyloid-{beta} accumulation that saturates years before the manifestation of clinical symptoms is dissociated with cognitive decline of the disease 7. It is unknown how these two processes are mechanistically linked. In this and our accompanied study, we report that thiamine pyrophosphokinase-1 (TPK) deficiency plays essential roles in both processes via distinct mechanisms. Here we describe that diminished microglia Tpk controls the propagation of amyloid-{beta} plaques. In APP/PS1 transgenic mice, microglia showed elevated Tpk expression at 2-month-old, but reduction in a plaque-centric manner at 8-month-old. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide, but not amyloid-{beta}, induceed Tpk reduction in cultured microglia. Tpk reduction led to microglia dysfunction, showing volatile motility but reduced phagocytosis and weak response to focal tissue injury, with accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets and abnormal mitochrondria. In Alzheimers disease mice, microglia-specific knockout of Tpk caused diminished plaque coverage, exacerbated plaque burden and synaptic loss. However, increased plaques were not accompanied by the development of neurofibrillary tangles or brain atrophy, in contrast to the phenotype described in our accompanied paper with neuronal Tpk deletion. In conclusion, plaque-induced inflammation reduces Tpk in microglia, selectively exacerbating the spread of amyloid pathology.",

Here, we identify netoglitazone, an antidiabetic compound previously tested in humans, as an A{beta} aggregation antagonist. Netoglitazone improved cognition and reduced microglia activity in a mouse model of AD. Using quantitative whole-brain three-dimensional histology (Q3D), we precisely identified brain regions where netoglitazone reduced the number and size of A{beta} plaques. We demonstrate the utility of Q3D in preclinical drug evaluation for AD by providing a high-resolution brain-wide view of drug efficacy. Applying Q3D has the potential to improve pre-clinical drug evaluation by providing information that can help identify mechanisms leading to brain region-specific drug efficacy.\n\nSignificance statementAlzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Its primary symptom is progressive cognitive decline, which impairs executive brain functions and deprives patients of their autonomy in life. Experimental and clinical evidence points to the critical pathophysiological role of the amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptide. Despite some limited successes in AD immunotherapy targeting A{beta}, AD is still incurable. Here, we use an innovative pipeline for accurate whole-brain measurements of A{beta} load to test the efficacy of the antidiabetic compound, netoglitazone. We found that netoglitazone decreases A{beta} burden in certain brain areas but not in others. Region-specific assessment of anti-A{beta} efficacy may be useful in the development of effective drugs against Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework BEATRICE to identify putative causal variants from GWAS statistics. Identifying causal variants is challenging due to their sparsity and high correlation in the nearby regions. To account for these challenges, we rely on a hierarchical Bayesian model that imposes a binary concrete prior on the set of causal variants. We derive a variational algorithm for this fine-mapping problem by minimizing the KL divergence between an approximate density and the posterior probability distribution of the causal configurations. Correspondingly, we use a deep neural network as an inference machine to estimate the parameters of our proposal distribution. Our stochastic optimization procedure allows us to simultaneously sample from the space of causal configurations. We use these samples to compute the posterior inclusion probabilities and determine credible sets for each causal variant. We conduct a detailed simulation study to quantify the performance of our framework against two state-of-the-art baseline methods across different numbers of causal variants and different noise paradigms, as defined by the relative genetic contributions of causal and non-causal variants. We demonstrate that BEATRICE achieves uniformly better coverage with comparable power and set sizes, and that the performance gain increases with the number of causal variants. We also show the efficacy BEATRICE in finding causal variants from the GWAS study of Alzheimers disease. In comparison to the baselines, only BEATRICE can successfully find the APOE{epsilon} 2 allele, a commonly associated variant of Alzheimers. Thus, we show that BEATRICE is a valuable tool to identify causal variants from eQTL and GWAS summary statistics across complex diseases and traits.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of the endolysosomal system within neurons is a prominent feature of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology. Multiple AD-risk factors are known to cause hyper-activity of the early-endosome small GTPase rab5, resulting in neuronal endosomal pathway disruption. APPL1, an important rab5 effector protein, is an interface between endosomal and neuronal function through a rab5-activating interaction with the BACE1-generated C-terminal fragment ({beta}CTF or C99) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a pathogenic APP fragment generated within endolysosomal compartments. To better understand the role of APPL1 in the AD endosomal phenotype, we generated a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human APPL1 within neurons (Thy1-APPL1 mice). Consistent with the important endosomal regulatory role of APPL1, Thy1-APPL1 mice have enlarged neuronal early endosomes and increased synaptic endocytosis due to increased rab5 activation. We additionally demonstrate pathological consequences of APPL1 overexpression, including functional changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), as well as degeneration of the large projection cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and impairment of hippocampal-dependent memory. Our findings show that increased neuronal APPL1 levels lead to a cascade of pathological effects within neurons, including early endosomal alterations, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Multiple risk factors and molecular regulators, including APPL1 activity, are known to contribute to the endosomal dysregulation seen in the early stages of AD, and these findings further highlight the shared pathobiology and consequences to a neuron of early endosomal pathway disruption.\n\nSignificance StatementDysfunction in the endolysosomal system within neurons is a key feature of Alzheimers disease (AD).

    "abstract": "Study objectivesSleep disturbances are considered both a risk factor and symptom of dementia. The present research aimed to identify cognitive tests that are sensitive to sleep-dependent cognition, focusing on cognitive tests designed to evaluate the earliest cognitive changes in dementia.\n\nMethodsIn Experiment 1, we recruited younger (n=89) and older (n=40) adults and remotely monitored their sleep patterns for 7 consecutive days using actigraphy and sleep diaries. On day 7, participants completed a battery of cognitive tests, which included the Prodromal Alzheimers and MCI battery from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of a night of total sleep deprivation on cognitive performance in young adults. We observed a sleep deprived group (n=16) overnight in the lab. The rested control group (n=32) slept normally at home.\n\nResultsIn Experiment 1, there was a significant relationship between performance on MST and total sleep time in the older adults. There were no relationships between cognitive performance and sleep quantity or quality in the younger adults. In the older adults, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were correlated with performance on the CANTAB and MST. In Experiment 2, the young adults who underwent 24-hour sleep deprivation performed worse than the rested participants on the MST task.\n\nConclusionPerformance on cognitive tests designed to assess pattern separation are sensitive to sleep patterns, particularly in older adults and should be evaluated for potential use as clinical trial outcome measures for sleep-promoting treatments.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThere is growing emphasis on the importance of sleep as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimers disease). Finding cognitive measures sensitive to sleep are needed for use as outcome measures in clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of sleep-promoting interventions. Our research addresses this need by investigating the relationship between sleep patterns and performance on a variety of cognitive tests. Our results suggest that cognitive tests designed to assess pattern separation are uniquely sensitive to sleep quality and quantity, particularly in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Functional lateralization is a cardinal feature of human brain, and deviations from typical lateralization are observed in various brain disorders. Although this phenomenon has been widely acknowledged in the field of human neuroscience, decades of research have shown that it is a challenge to bridge the gap between (a)typically lateralized functions and hemispheric differences in structure (termed structural asymmetry). To address this important question, the present study employed the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to investigate the brain structural asymmetry and its associations with cognitive functions, aging, and aging-related diseases, by integrating large-scale datasets. Our proposed multivariate approach revealed previously unknown and substantial structural differences between the left and right hemispheres, and established the associations between the global brain asymmetry and lateralized functions including hand motor and emotion processing. Furthermore, at the population level we mapped the aging trajectories of the global brain asymmetry, and unveiled significant diagnosis-specific variations in patients with Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease, and individuals carrying a relevant genetic risk for atypical brain aging (i.e., APOE4 carriers). These results demonstrated left-hemisphere-linked changes in aging, which has challenged the traditional \"right hemi-aging\" model, and offered a promising approach for assessing brain aging and related diseases. Overall, our study with a novel approach presents one of the largest-scale investigation of global brain asymmetry, and takes an important step forward in understanding the intricate interplay between structural asymmetry, lateralized functions, and brain aging in health and disease.\n\nSignificance statementFunctional lateralization is fundamental to the human brain, with deviations linked to various brain disorders. Bridging the gap between functional lateralization and structural asymmetry has been a long-standing challenge. Using advanced machine learning and large-scale datasets, this study introduced a multivariate global brain asymmetry approach and revealed previously unidentified structural differences between the brain hemispheres, correlating these with cognitive functions, aging, and diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. Contrary to the traditional \"right hemi-aging\" model, we found left-hemisphere-linked aging changes. This work provides new insights into brain asymmetry, lateralized functions, and aging, offering a promising approach for assessing brain health and disease.\n\nClassifications: Biological Sciences (Psychological and Cognitive Sciences);",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite various hypotheses, including differences in longevity, hormones, genetics, and neuroanatomy, the reasons for the higher prevalence of Alzheimers disease in older women compared to men remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that the precuneus, a key region of the default mode network, is linked to internally focused processes like memory retrieval. This study examined sex differences in the relationship between precuneus volumes and working memory retrieval speed in cognitively normal older adults, hypothesizing that disparities in precuneus size and function contribute to reduced working memory performance in older women.\n\nMethodA cohort of participants (N=45; 25 women; Mage =77) from the University of Kentucky Alzheimers Disease Research Center completed the Bluegrass Working Memory Task while undergoing 3T Siemens magnetic resonance imaging scans.\n\nResultApplying Spearman correlation analyses, the results revealed correlations between working memory accuracy and volumes in the left (r=-.43, p<.01) and right (r=-.36, p<.05) precuneus across all subjects. Sex difference analysis indicated a tendency for the accuracy of the memory task to correlate more frequently with the left precuneus in women (r= 0.54; p < 0.05) than in men. Similarly, volumes in the left precuneus displayed a significant negative correlation with reaction time in response to memory target (r = -0.426; p < 0.05) and memory distractor (r = -0.549; p < 0.01) in women. There is a sex difference in accuracy and speed trade-off. While men were faster in reaction time, women were better in the accuracy of the memory task. Particularly noteworthy was the consistent association in women, where neurocognitive measures (Trail A, r= -.50, p<.01; Trail B, r= -.06, p<.01) reliably correlated with volumes in the left precuneus--a relationship not observed in men.\n\nDiscussionOur findings suggest that the left precuneus volume is associated with processing speed and accuracy of working memory performance, especially in women. Given that the left precuneus plays a key role in supporting various aspects of cognition, including memory retrieval, our findings point to the potential of reaction time serving as a surrogate marker for fMRI in predicting cognitive decline, particularly when considering sex differences.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction is one of the primary hallmarks of both Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, leading to cognitive and behavioural decline. While alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau are involved in the physiological functioning of synapses, their pathological aggregation has been linked to synaptic dysfunction. However, the methodology for studying the small (sub-diffraction limit) and soluble aggregates -often called oligomers, formed by these proteins is limited. Here we describe SynPull, a novel method combining single-molecule pulldown, super-resolution microscopy, and advanced computational analyses, in order to reliably study the quantity and morphology of the oligomeric alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and AT8-positive tau aggregates in synaptosomes harvested from post-mortem human brain samples and mouse models. Using SynPull, we show that AT8-positive tau is the predominant aggregate type in AD, with significantly more aggregates compared to the control samples, yet the aggregate size does not differ between disease and control samples. Meanwhile, the relatively smaller amount of alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid aggregates found in the synapses are larger than the extra-synaptic ones. Collectively, these results show the utility of SynPull to study pathological aggregates in dementia, which can help further understand the disease mechanisms causing synaptic dysfunction.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/609517v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d53d06org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1995971org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf3edaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b75ca5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical abstract.C_FLOATNO Human post-mortem orbitofrontal cortex samples from subjects with neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, as well as age-matched controls cut into [~]300 mg sections, and MI2, APPNL-G-F, P301S, and C57Bl/6J mouse brains were first homogenised in synaptosome buffer using a Dounce homogeniser and then filtered and centrifuged to separate nuclei and organelles from the synaptic fragments.

    "abstract": "PurposeSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is producing vast amounts of individual cell profiling data. Analysis of such datasets presents a significant challenge in accurately annotating cell types and their associated biomarkers. scRNA-seq datasets analysis will help us understand diseases such as Alzheimers, Cancer, Diabetes, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Systemic Lupus Ery-thematosus (SLE), etc. Recently different pipelines based on machine learning (ML) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods have been employed to tackle these issues utilizing scRNA-seq datasets. These pipelines have arisen as a promising resource and are capable of extracting meaningful and concise features from noisy, diverse, and high-dimensional data to enhance annotations and subsequent analysis. Existing tools require high computational resources to execute large sample datasets.\n\nMethodsWe have developed a cutting-edge platform known as scaLR (Single Cell Analysis using Low Resource) that efficiently processes data in batches, and reduces the required resources for processing large datasets and running NN models. scaLR is equipped with data processing, feature extraction, training, evaluation, and downstream analysis. The data processing module consists of sample-wise & standard scaler normalization and splitting of data. Its novel feature extraction algorithm, first trains the model on a feature subset and stores feature importance for all the features in that subset. At the end of this process, top K features are selected based on their importance. The model is trained on top K features, its performance evaluation and associated downstream analysis provide significant biomarkers for different cell types and diseases/traits.\n\nResultsTo showcase the capabilities of scaLR, we utilized several scRNA-seq datasets of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), Alzheimers patients, and large datasets from human and mouse embryonic development. Our findings indicate that scaLR offers comparable prediction accuracy and requires less model training time and compute resources than existing Python-based pipelines and frameworks. Moreover, scaLR efficiently handles large sample datasets (>11.4 million cells) with minimal resource usage (29GB RAM, 12GB GPU, and 8 CPUs) while maintaining high prediction accuracy and being capable of ranking the biomarker association with specific cell types and diseases.\n\nConclusionWe present scaLR a Python-based platform, engineered to utilize minimal computational resources while maintaining comparable execution times to existing frameworks. It is highly scalable and capable of efficiently handling datasets containing millions of cell samples and providing their classification and important biomarkers.",

The clinical efficacy of this approach was shown in the multimodal FINGER trial, yet knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms is limited. In the current study, we applied for the first time a multimodal lifestyle intervention in mice to study effects on cognition and associated molecular pathways.\n\nMethodsWe have established a novel experimental model, the lifestyle intervention PAW (Prevention of Alzheimers by a Multimodal Lifestyle Protocol - Working-mechanisms for Memory Gains) in mice. In this model, we combined different modalities of intervention aiming to achieve synergistic effects. The animals were given access to running wheels (voluntary exercise), Fortasyn Connect (a medical food that slows disease progression in early Alzheimers disease), and they were subjected to cognitive training in an IntelliCage environment (PAW group). To separately investigate the effects of pharmacological vascular management as a preventive measure, another group of mice was given Atorvastatin and Enalapril (cholesterol and blood pressure lowering pharmaceuticals, respectively) dosed in the diet (Pharma group). Control mice were housed in normal conditions. We included 12 wild type C57BL/6J female mice 6.5 months of age per group. The full intervention lasted for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and the end of the intervention. All mice underwent a battery of behavioural testing after the eight weeks of intervention. Hippocampi were dissected for proteomics analysis.\n\nResultsDuring the intervention, the PAW group actively participated in the intervention by learning the different cognitive training programs and by using the running wheels. At the end of the intervention, the PAW group showed a lowering of blood pressure to a similar extent as in the Pharma group (systolic 158 mmHg to 139 mmHg, p = 0.003, and 163 mmHg to 136 mmHg, p = 0.042, respectively). Furthermore, the PAW group displayed a better short-term spatial working memory compared to the control group as assessed by the spontaneous alternation in the Y maze test (66.5% and 56.7%, respectively, p = 0.036). Proteomic analysis of the hippocampi and downstream bioinformatic analysis revealed that several pathways were upregulated in the PAW mice including synaptogenesis (Z = 4.27, p = 1.26E-18) and glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors and synaptic plasticity (Z = 3.74, p = 3.16E-19).\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that the PAW model effectively mimics the clinical effects of multimodal lifestyle dementia prevention, and further demonstrates the activation of hippocampal-specific molecular drivers of memory gains.",

    "abstract": "During brain development, synapses are initially formed in excess and are later eliminated in an activity-dependent manner, with weak synapses being preferentially removed. Previous studies identified glia as mediators of synapse removal, but it is unclear how glia specifically target weak synapses. Here we show that, in the developing mouse visual pathway, inhibiting synaptic transmission induces postsynaptic activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 is essential for synapse elimination driven by both spontaneous and experience-dependent neural activity. Synapse weakening-induced caspase-3 activation determines the specificity of synapse elimination mediated by microglia but not astrocytes. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease, caspase-3 deficiency protects against synapse loss induced by amyloid-{beta} deposition. Our results reveal caspase-3 activation as a key step in activity-dependent synapse elimination during development and synapse loss in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "To enhance early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD), understanding the pathological changes before symptoms arise is crucial. The continuum model of AD suggest that A{beta} beta (A{beta}) accumulation precedes symptoms by at least 15 years, with vascular changes detectable around this time. Disturbances in capillary flow dynamics have been linked to reduced oxygen delivery to brain tissue, but evidence in presymptomatic AD remains elusive. We examined capillary flow dynamics in presymptomatic Tg-SwDI mice and the capacity of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) to prevent capillary flow disturbances. Our study revealed capillary flow disturbances associated with alterations in capillary morphology, adhesion molecule expression, and A{beta} load in cognitively normal 9-10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice. Treated mice showed ameliorated capillary flow disturbances, enhanced oxygen availability, and reduced A{beta} load. These findings underscore the importance of capillary flow disturbances in presymptomatic AD and highlight CAIs potential for preserving vascular integrity in early AD.",

XCI analysis of skin cells from hybrid mice validates our approach and reveals biased inactivation of X-chromosomes among cell types. In human lung and brain cells, XCI status can be determined in 33.8% and 23.6% of cells. Among the patients, cells with opposite inactivation patterns differently express members of specific gene families and pathways. Alzheimers disease patients show reversal of XCI in cortical microglia and regional increase in biallelic expression denoting epigenetic erosion.

However, most unsupervised methods instead focus on identifying tissue regions, representing them as positively covarying low-frequency spatial patterns of gene expression over the tissue. Here, we extend this frequency-based (i.e. harmonic) approach to show that negatively covarying high frequencies represent interactions. Similarly, combinations of low and high frequencies represent interactions along large length scales, or, equivalently, region boundaries. The resulting equations further reveal a duality in which regions and interactions are complementary representations of the same underlying information, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. We demonstrate these concepts in multiple datasets from human lymph node, human tonsil, and mouse models of Alzheimers disease.

Here the effect of chronic administration of two Na+ channel inhibitors with different mechanisms of action, phenytoin and GS967 are tested in mouse models of different stages of Alzheimers disease. Subtle changes in the distribution of plaque sizes were observed in AppNLGF/NLGF mouse at 3 months of age, after being fed control or drug-supplemented chow from weaning onwards, with phenytoin treatment resulting in a significant increase in the frequency of the smallest plaques and a decrease in large plaques. The later pathology of neurofibrillary tangles was studied, in old age, by supplementing the food of transgenic mice with a P301L mutation in Tau. Chronic administration of Na+ inhibitors from 15 months of age resulted in a decrease in the density of MC1-positive neurofibrillary tangles, possibly due to effects on microglial Na+ channels. The density of microglial cells was strongly correlated with the density of neurofibrillary tangles but only in mice treated with the Na+ inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimers disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.",

Here, we examined human-relevant cellular phenotypes across neurodevelopment using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cortical and ganglionic eminence organoids (COs and GEOs). In COs, we showed that APOE4 decreased BRN2+ and SATB2+ cortical neurons, increased astrocytes and outer radial glia, and was associated with increased cell death and dysregulated GABA-related gene expression. In GEOs, APOE4 accelerated maturation of neural progenitors and neurons. Multi-electrode array recordings in assembloids revealed that APOE4 disrupted network formation and altered response to GABA, resulting in heightened excitability and synchronicity.

Most existing deconvolution methods fail to account for the heterogeneity in cell type-specific (CTS) expression across bulk samples, ignore discrepancies between CTS expression in bulk and cell type reference data, and provide no guidance on cell type reference selection or integration. To address these issues, we introduce BLEND, a hierarchical Bayesian method that leverages multiple reference datasets. BLEND learns the most suitable references for each bulk sample by exploring the convex hulls of references and employs a \"bag-of-words\" representation for bulk count data for deconvolution. To speed up the computation, we provide an efficient EM algorithm for parameter estimation. Notably, BLEND requires no data transformation, normalization, cell type marker gene selection, or reference quality evaluation. Benchmarking studies on both simulated and real human brain data highlight BLENDs superior performance in various scenarios. The analysis of Alzheimers disease data illustrates BLENDs application in real data and reference resource integration.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of the sex-dimorphic aging remain foggy, with limited studies across multiple tissues. We systematically analyzed [~]17,000 transcriptomes from 35 human tissues to quantitatively evaluate the individual and combined contributions of sex and age to transcriptomic variations. We discovered extensive sex-dimorphisms during aging with distinct patterns of change in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). Intriguingly, the male-biased age-associated AS events have a stronger association with Alzheimers disease, and the females-biased events are often regulated by several sex-biased splicing factors that may be controlled by estrogen receptors. Breakpoint analysis showed sex-dimorphic aging rates that are significantly associated with decline of sex hormones, with males having a larger and earlier transcriptome change. Collectively, this study uncovered an essential role of sex during aging at the molecular and multi-tissue levels, providing insight into sex-dimorphic regulatory patterns.",

To this end, we investigated the natural feeding behavior of young and aged rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to understand the age-related differences in tongue and jaw kinematics. We tracked tongue and jaw movements in 3D using high-resolution biplanar videoradiography and X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM).

    "abstract": "Brain inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human tau in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by inclusion formation and swelling of lamina glial cells. We found that inclusions are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Co-expression of human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) with tau in the retina does not affect tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the tau-expressing retina. Our results suggest that glial glucose metabolism contributes to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in tauopathy.\n\nHighlightsO_LITau expression in the fly retina induces glial activation\nC_LIO_LIPigment glial cells mediate inflammatory phenotypes in the degenerating retina\nC_LIO_LIEnhanced glucose uptake in the pigment glia suppresses inflammation and photoreceptor neurodegeneration caused by tau expression\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is caused by the assembly of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides into oligomers and fibrils. Endogenous A{beta} aggregation may be assisted by cell membranes, which can accelerate the nucleation step enormously, but knowledge of membrane-assisted aggregation is still very limited. Here we used extensive MD simulations to structurally and energetically characterize key intermediates along the membrane-assisted aggregation pathways of A{beta}40. Reinforcing experimental observations, the simulations reveal unique roles of GM1 ganglioside and cholesterol in stabilizing membrane-embedded {beta}-sheets and of Y10 and K28 in the ordered release of a small oligomeric seed into solution. The same seed leads to either an open-shaped or R-shaped fibril, with significant stabilization provided by inter- or intra-subunit interfaces between a straight {beta}- sheet (residues Q15-D23) and a bent {beta}-sheet (residues A30-V36). This work presents the first comprehensive picture of membrane-assisted aggregation of A{beta}40, with broad implications for developing AD therapies and rationalizing disease-specific polymorphisms of amyloidogenic proteins.",

    "abstract": "Breakdown of lipid homeostasis is thought to contribute to pathological aging, the largest risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). Cognitive reserve theory posits a role for compensatory mechanisms in the aging brain in preserving neuronal circuit functions, staving off cognitive decline, and mitigating risk for AD. However, the identities of such mechanisms have remained elusive. A screen for hippocampal dentate granule cell (DGC) synapse loss-induced factors identified a secreted phospholipase, Pla2g2f, whose expression increases in DGCs during aging. Pla2g2f deletion in DGCs exacerbates aging-associated pathophysiological changes including synapse loss, inflammatory microglia, reactive astrogliosis, impaired neurogenesis, lipid dysregulation and hippocampal-dependent memory loss. Conversely, boosting Pla2g2f in DGCs during aging is sufficient to preserve synapses, reduce inflammatory microglia and reactive gliosis, prevent hippocampal-dependent memory impairment and modify trajectory of cognitive decline. Ex vivo, neuronal-PLA2G2F mediates intercellular signaling to decrease lipid droplet burden in microglia. Boosting Pla2g2f expression in DGCs of an aging-sensitive AD model reduces amyloid load and improves memory. Our findings implicate PLA2G2F as a compensatory neuroprotective factor that maintains lipid homeostasis to counteract aging-associated cognitive decline.",

They may also be useful for Alzheimers disease (AD) to diminish iron from microbleeds. DFO may also stimulate antioxidant membrane repair which is impaired during AD. DFO, and other chelators do enter the brain despite some contrary reports.\n\nObjectiveLow dose, oral DFO was given in lab chow to wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice to evaluate potential impact on iron levels, iron-signaling and storage proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) and processing enzymes. Young WT mice do not have microbleeds or disrupted blood-brain barrier of AD mice.\n\nMethodsIron was measured by MRI and chemically after two weeks of dietary DFO. Cerebral cortex was examined for changes in iron metabolism, antioxidant signaling, and APP processing by Western blot.\n\nResultsDFO decreased brain iron by 18% (MRI) and decreased seven major proteins that mediate iron metabolism by at least 25%. The iron storage proteins ferritin light and heavy chain decreased by at least 30%. APP and secretase enzymes also decreased by 30%.\n\nConclusionsWT mice respond to DFO with decreased APP, amyloid processing enzymes, and antioxidant repair. Potential DFO treatment for early-stage AD by DFO should consider the benefits of lowered APP and secretase enzymes.",

Fluorescent probes (fluoroprobes), such as thioflavin T (ThT), have been essential tools for studying tau aggregation; however, most of them do not discriminate between amyloid fibril conformations (polymorphs). This gap is due, in part, to a lack of high-throughput methods for screening large, diverse chemical collections. Here, we leverage advances in protein adaptive differential scanning fluorimetry (paDSF) to screen the Aurora collection of 300+ fluorescent dyes against multiple synthetic tau fibril polymorphs. This screen, coupled with orthogonal secondary assays, revealed pan-fibril binding chemotypes, as well as fluoroprobes selective for subsets of fibrils. One fluoroprobe recognized tau pathology in ex vivo brain slices from Alzheimers disease patients. We propose that these scaffolds represent entry points for development of selective fibril ligands and, more broadly, that high throughput, fluorescence-based dye screening is a platform for their discovery.",

This innovative end-to-end framework combines global alignment and non-rigid registration modules, specifically designed to handle structural, intensity, and domain variances in 3D brain imaging data. Our approach outperforms the baseline model in handling these shifts, achieving results that align closely with clinical ground-truth measurements. We demonstrate its efficacy on 3D brain data from healthy individuals and dementia patients, with particular success in quantifying brain atrophy, a key biomarker for Alzheimers disease and other brain disorders. By effectively managing variability in multisite, multi-scanner neuroimaging studies, our approach enhances the precision of atrophy measurements for clinical trials and longitudinal studies.

However, the noncoding localization of these variants has made the assignment of target genes for brain cell types challenging. Genomic approaches that infer chromosomal 3D architecture can link noncoding risk variants and distal gene regulatory elements such as enhancers to gene promoters. By using enhancer-to-promoter interactome maps for microglia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, we identified cell-type-specific enrichment of genetic heritability for brain disorders through stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression. Our analysis suggests that genetic heritability for multiple neurodegenerative disorders is enriched at microglial chromatin contact sites. Through Hi-C coupled multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (H-MAGMA) we identified disease risk genes for Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We found that disease-risk genes were overrepresented in microglia compared to other brain cell types across neurodegenerative conditions. Notably, the microglial risk genes and pathways identified were largely specific to each disease. Our findings reinforce microglia as an important, genetically informed cell type for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative conditions and highlight potentially targetable disease-relevant pathways.",

Humans accumulate with age the pigment neuromelanin inside neurons that synthesize catecholamines. Neurons reaching the highest neuromelanin levels preferentially degenerate in Parkinsons, Alzheimers and apparently healthy aging individuals. However, this brain pigment is not taken into consideration in current animal models because common laboratory species, such as rodents, do not produce neuromelanin. Here we generate a tissue-specific transgenic mouse, termed tgNM, that mimics the human age-dependent brain-wide distribution of neuromelanin within catecholaminergic regions, based on the constitutive catecholamine-specific expression of human melanin-producing enzyme tyrosinase. We show that, in parallel to progressive human-like neuromelanin pigmentation, these animals display age-related neuronal dysfunction and degeneration affecting numerous brain circuits and body tissues, linked to motor and non-motor deficits, reminiscent of early neurodegenerative stages.

This pathological process prevents the physiological interaction of Tau with microtubules to the detriment of the structural integrity of neurons. In healthy cells, aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation are counteracted by chaperone proteins whose protective capacity decreases with age. The role of the chaperone Hsp90 and the mechanism by which it can prevent Tau aggregation toxicity are controversial. The innovative strategy of mimicking Hsp90 through the design of the {beta}-hairpin like peptidomimetic {beta}-Hsp90, inspired by two Hsp90/Tau interaction sequences, is presented here. {beta}-Hsp90 inhibits Tau aggregation both in vitro and in cells, restoring Taus physiological interaction with microtubules. {beta}-Hsp90, which interacts with the P1 region of Tau, is more effective than individual peptide sequences from the chaperone HSP90 and another {beta}-hairpin mimic based on Tau sequences. Moreover, {beta}-Hsp90 dramatically reduces AD-associated A{beta}1-42 aggregation, offering the development of a dual inhibitor.

However, it remains challenging to integrate and interpret multi-omics data for mining key disease targets and signaling pathways. Graph AI models have been widely used to analyze graph-structure datasets, and are ideal for integrative multi-omics data analysis because they can naturally integrate and represent multi-omics data as a biologically meaningful multi-level signaling graph and interpret multi-omics data via graph node and edge ranking analysis. However, it is non-trivial for graph-AI model developers to pre-analyze multi-omics data and convert the data into biologically meaningful graphs, which can be directly fed into graph-AI models. To resolve this challenge, we developed mosGraphGen (multi-omics signaling graph generator), generating Multi-omics Signaling graphs (mos-graph) of individual samples by mapping multi-omics data onto a biologically meaningful multi-level background signaling network with data normalization by aggregating measurements and aligning to the reference genome. With mosGraphGen, AI model developers can directly apply and evaluate their models using these mos-graphs.

    "abstract": "To the best of the authors knowledge, this paper presents the first attempt to develop a mathematical model of the formation and growth of inclusions containing misfolded TATA-box binding protein associated factor 15 (TAF15). It has recently been shown that TAF15 inclusions are involved in approximately 10% of cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimers disease (AD). It is characterized by a progressive loss of personality, behavioral changes, and a decline in language skills due to the degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. The model simulates TAF15 monomer production, nucleation and autocatalytic growth of free TAF15 aggregates, and their deposition into TAF15 inclusions. The accuracy of the numerical solution of the model equations is validated by comparing it with analytical solutions available for limiting cases. Physiologically relevant parameter values were used to predict TAF15 inclusion growth. It is shown that the growth of TAF15 inclusions is influenced by two opposing mechanisms: the rate at which free TAF15 aggregates are deposited into inclusions and the rate of autocatalytic production of free TAF15 aggregates from monomers. A low deposition rate slows inclusion growth, while a high deposition rate hinders the autocatalytic production of new aggregates, thus also slowing inclusion growth. Consequently, the rate of inclusion growth is maximized at an intermediate deposition rate of free TAF15 aggregates into TAF15 inclusions.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein that is important for lipid storage, transport, and metabolism. APOE gene variants are associated with Alzheimers disease (AD), as well as attentional function in healthy humans. Previous research has shown that Apoe transcription is increased following stimulation of the pathway between the locus coeruleus (LC) and frontal cortex (FC) in mice. This result suggests that Apoe may affect attentional function by virtue of its expression in circuits that control attention. Does Apoe causally regulate attention, or is its expression simply a byproduct of neuronal activity in the LC and FC? To answer this question, we synthetically induced Apoe transcription in the FC of male and female mice, and subsequently tested their ability to learn a touchscreen-based rodent version of the continuous performance test of sustained attention (the rCPT). We found that increased Apoe transcription impaired performance when attentional demand was increased in male mice, while in female mice, increased Apoe transcription significantly accelerated rCPT learning. We further found that this increase in Apoe transcription affected subsequent anxiety-like behavior and cellular activity in the FC in a sex-dependent manner. The results of this study provide insight into how Apoe causally regulates translationally relevant behaviors in rodent models.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid fibrils has been identified in tissues outside the brain, yet little is understood about the formation of extracerebral amyloidosis and its impact on the aging process of these organs. Here, we demonstrate that both transgenic mice modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) and naturally aging mice exhibit accumulated senescent bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds), accompanied by amyloid deposits surrounding the BMAds. Senescent BMAds acquire a secretory phenotype, resulting in a marked increase in the secretion of serum amyloid P component (SAP), also known as pentraxin 2 (PTX2). SAP/PTX2 colocalizes with amyloid deposits around senescent BMAds in vivo and is sufficient to promote the formation of insoluble amyloid deposits from soluble A{beta} peptides in in vitro and ex vivo 3D BMAd-based culture experiments. Additionally, Combined treatment with SAP/PTX2 and A{beta} peptides promotes osteoclastogenesis but inhibits osteoblastogenesis of the precursor cells. Transplantation of senescent BMAds into the bone marrow cavity of healthy young mice is sufficient to induce bone loss. Finally, pharmacological depletion of SAP/PTX2 from aged mice abolishes bone marrow amyloid deposition and effectively rescues the low bone mass phenotype. Thus, senescent BMAds, through the secretion of SAP/PTX2, contribute to the age-associated development of skeletal amyloidosis and resultant bone deficits.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing age-related alterations in brain networks is crucial for understanding aging trajectories and identifying deviations indicative of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimers disease. In this study, we developed a Fully Hyperbolic Neural Network (FHNN) to embed functional brain connectivity graphs derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data into low dimensions on a Lorentz model of hyperbolic space. Using this model, we computed hyperbolic embeddings of the MEG brain networks of 587 individuals from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) dataset. Notably, we leveraged a unique metric--the radius of the node embeddings--which effectively captures the hierarchical organization of the brain, to characterize subtle hierarchical organizational changes in various brain subnetworks attributed to the aging process. Our findings revealed that a considerable number of subnetworks exhibited a reduction in hierarchy during aging, with some showing gradual changes and others undergoing rapid transformations in the elderly. Moreover, we demonstrated that hyperbolic features outperform traditional graph-theoretic measures in capturing age-related information in brain networks. Overall, our study represents the first evaluation of hyperbolic embeddings in MEG brain networks for studying aging trajectories, shedding light on critical regions undergoing significant age-related alterations in the large cohort of the Cam-CAN dataset.",

The latter result from an abnormal metabolism of Amyloid-{beta} precursor protein (APP) leading to its accumulation in plaques. Ex vivo analysis of AD patients brains, show an abnormally elevated concentration of metals including Cu, Zn and Fe in these plaques. Some studies have also demonstrated altered Cu levels in the entire brain and more specifically in regions heavily affected in AD. These modifications are often accompanied by a decline in neuronal Cu levels and by an increase in the proportion of extracellular labile Cu, which in turn promotes reactive oxygen species formation. To correct this Cu dyshomeostasis, we designed and synthesized novel Cu(II)-selective peptide shuttles, capable of swiftly retrieving Cu from extracellular A{beta} and subsequently transporting and releasing Cu inside cells. We demonstrate here the capacity of this new Cu-shuttles, DapHH-R5W4NBD and HDapH-R5W4NBD, to protect organotypic hippocampal slices (OHSCs) from Cu(A{beta})-induced insult and their capability to rescues Cu-induced microglial activation and proliferation.",

The neurotoxic nature of these aggregates has been underscored by recent advances in therapies aimed at reducing their load. To make further progress towards the development of increasingly effective treatments, there is a still largely unmet need for reliable cell models that comprehensively recapitulate aggregate-driven AD pathology. Here, we report a robust and scalable pipeline for generating human iPSC-derived cortical neurons that display A{beta} aggregates in their axonal projections. This phenotype is caused by a repeated dosage of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) to simulate the chronic inflammatory environment characteristic of AD and enhanced in neurons carrying the Swedish mutation. In association with the increased A{beta} deposits in the cell bodies, this cell model exhibits other key hallmarks of AD, including structural alterations of synapses, electrophysiological asynchronous hyperactivity, and hypermetabolism. Overall, these results illustrate how repeated TNF treatment models central aspects of AD pathology, and provides a platform that could be used for facilitating the translation of potential drugs to clinical applications.",

It has been shown that -synuclein can spread from a donor cell to neighboring cells and thus propagate cellular damage, antagonizing the effectiveness of therapies such as transplantation of fetal or iPSC derived dopaminergic cells. As we and others previously have shown, insufficient lysosomal function due to genetic mutations or targeted disruption of cathepsin D can cause -synuclein accumulation. We here investigated whether overexpression of cathepsin D or knockout (KO) of the transcriptional suppressor of lysosomal biogenesis ZKSCAN3 can attenuate propagation of -synuclein aggregation and cell death. We examined dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra using stereology of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells 4 months and 6 months after intrastriatal injection of -synuclein preformed fibrils or monomeric -synuclein control in control, central nervous system (CNS)-cathepsin D overexpressing and CNS-specific ZKSCAN3 KO mice. We also examined pS129--synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra, cortex, amygdala and striatum. The extent of dopaminergic neurodegeneration and pS129--synuclein aggregation in the brains of CNS-specific ZKSCAN3 knockout mice and CNS-cathepsin D overexpressing mice was similar to that observed in wild-type mice. Our results indicate that neither enhancing cathepsin D expression nor disrupting ZKSCAN3 in the CNS is sufficient to attenuate pS129--synuclein aggregate accumulation or dopaminergic neurodegeneration.",

Current methods often fail to integrate diverse multi-relational biological data meaningfully, limiting the discovery of novel risk genes and drugs. To address this, we present MedGraphNet, a multi-relational Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to infer relationships among drugs, genes, diseases, and phenotypes. MedGraphNet initializes nodes using informative embeddings from existing text knowledge, allowing for robust integration of various data types and improved generalizability. Our results demonstrate that MedGraphNet matches and often outperforms traditional single-relation approaches, particularly in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes. The model shows generalizability to external datasets, achieving high accuracy in identifying disease-gene associations and drug-phenotype relationships. Notably, MedGraphNet accurately inferred drug side effects without direct training on such data. Using Alzheimers disease as a case study, MedGraphNet successfully identified relevant phenotypes, genes, and drugs, corroborated by existing literature. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating multi-relational data with text knowledge to enhance biomedical predictions and drug repurposing for diseases.MedGraphNet code is available at https://github.com/vinash85/MedGraphNet",

We and others previously showed that a non-invasive multisensory gamma stimulation using light and sound at 40 Hz ameliorated Alzheimers disease pathology and symptoms in mouse models. In this study, we tested the effects of 40 Hz multisensory stimulation in the Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of DS. For three weeks, mice were exposed daily to one hour of stimulation or one hour of ambient light and sound. Mice receiving the stimulation showed improved object recognition and spatial working memory. Using single nuclei RNA-seq and experimental validations in mouse hippocampal samples, we identified underlying expression changes in gene regulatory networks and demonstrated increased adult neurogenesis and reorganization of synapses as potential mechanisms for these improved cognitive phenotypes. Together, our data reveal a novel effect of multisensory gamma stimulation on adult neurogenesis and beneficial effects of 40 Hz treatment on cognitive function in DS model mice.\n\nSignificance StatementWe present strong evidence, using a well-characterized mouse model, that the cognitive and neurogenesis deficits in Down syndrome can be improved through non-invasive multi-sensory gamma stimulation.

Their characteristics promote liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the formation of membraneless organelles such as stress granules and nucleoli. IDR-RBPs are particularly relevant in the nervous system and their dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumor development. Serpine1 mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) is a unique member of this group, being mostly disordered and lacking canonical RNA-binding domains. We defined SERBP1s interactome, uncovered novel roles in splicing, cell division and ribosomal biogenesis, and showed its participation in pathological stress granules and Tau aggregates in Alzheimers brains. SERBP1 preferentially interacts with other G-quadruplex (G4) binders, implicated in different stages of gene expression, suggesting that G4 binding is a critical component of SERBP1 function in different settings. Similarly, we identified important associations between SERBP1 and PARP1/polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation). SERBP1 interacts with PARP1 and its associated factors and influences PARylation. Moreover, protein complexes in which SERBP1 participates contain mostly PARylated proteins and PAR binders. Based on these results, we propose a feedback regulatory model in which SERBP1 influences PARP1 function and PARylation, while PARylation modulates SERBP1 functions and participation in regulatory complexes.",

Moreover, the causal relationship between molecular alterations and aging-associated decline in functions of different cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically characterized gene regulatory networks in a cell type-specific manner in the aging mouse hippocampus, a central brain region involved in learning and memory formation, by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single nuclei level. The analysis of multiome (RNA and ATAC) sequencing recapitulated the diversity of glial and neuronal cell types in the hippocampus, and allowed revealing transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility level changes in different cell types, among which oligodendrocytes and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons exhibited the most drastic changes. We found that aging-dependent chromatin-level changes were more pronounced than transcriptomic changes for genes related to synaptic plasticity among neurons. Our data suggest that BACH2, a candidate transcription factor in the aging- mediated functional decline of DG neurons, potentially regulates genes associated with synaptic plasticity, cell death, and inflammation during aging.",

Evidence suggests that activating neurons expressing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the TRN may enhance sleep quality and potentially ameliorate neuropathology associated with AD. However, the precise mechanisms through which TRN influences sleep disruptions and AD pathophysiology remain poorly understood.

Furthermore, the application of a two-virus strategy inadvertently led to non-specific opsin expression beyond the targeted TRN area.

Whether it contributes to sleep variability in humans is not yet established. Here, we investigated if the in vivo activity of the LC is related to the variability in the quality of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.\n\nMethodsWe assessed the LC activity of 34 healthy younger ([~]22y) and 18 older ([~]61y) individuals engaged in bottom-up and top-down cognitive tasks using 7-Tesla functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We further recorded their sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate associations between LC fMRI measures and REM sleep EEG metrics.\n\nResultsTheta oscillation energy during REM sleep was positively associated with LC response in the top-down task. In contrast, REM sleep theta energy was negatively associated with LC activity in older individuals during the bottom-up task. Importantly, sigma oscillations power immediately preceding a REM sleep episode was positively associated with LC activity in the top-down task.\n\nInterpretationLC activity during wakefulness was related to REM sleep intensity and to a transient EEG change preceding REM sleep, a feature causally related to LC activity in animal studies. The associations depend on the cognitive task, suggesting that a balanced level of LC tonic activity during wakefulness is required for optimal expression of REM sleep. The findings may have implications for the high prevalence of sleep complaints reported in aging and for disorders such as insomnia, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons disease, for which the LC may play pivotal roles through sleep.",

Although varying in vitro factors are known, in vivo factors breaking supersaturation are unclear. We found that flowing by a peristaltic pump effectively triggers amyloid formation of hen egg white lysozyme, a model amyloidogenic protein, and, moreover, amyloidosis-associated proteins (i.e. -synuclein, amyloid {beta} 1-40, and {beta}2-microglobulin). The peristaltic pump-dependent amyloid formation was visualized by a fluorescence microscope with looped flow system, revealing dynamic motions under flow. Among them, amyloid fibrils of amyloid {beta} 1-40 were stickier than others, self-associating, absorbing to loop surfaces, and surging upon flicking the loop, implying early stages of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. On the other hand, {beta}2-microglobulin at a neutral pH showed unique two-step amyloid formation with an oligomeric trapped intermediate, which might mimic amyloid formation in patients. Peristalsis-caused strong shear stresses were considered to mechanically break supersaturation. Shearing stresses occur in vivo at varying levels, suggesting that they break otherwise persistent supersaturation, thus triggering amyloid formation and ultimately leading to amyloidosis.

Alongside the use of prior data, we report new magic angle spinning NMR studies of glutamine residues of the polyQ fibril core and surface, distinguished via hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). Our study provides a new understanding of the structure of the core as well as surface of aggregated HTTex1, including the fuzzy coat and polyQ-water interface. The obtained data are discussed in context of their implications for understanding the detection of such aggregates (diagnostics) as well as known biological properties of the fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Aggregates of non-globular proteins are associated to several degenerative disorders, e.g. -synuclein and tau involved in Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases. Do these proteins suffer progressive changes in conformations and interactions in pathologic situations? In-cell NMR provides atomic-scale information in live cells but, until now, only at ~283 K in the case of unfolded proteins. Here, we report new labeling and acquisition methods enabling in-cell NMR at 310 K to study these proteins at micromolar concentrations, i.e. native cellular abundances. We used stable human cell lines expressing -synuclein or tau upon induction in a culture medium supplemented with 13C-labeled amino acids, or precursors thereof. Acquiring 13C-13CO spectra permitted an early residue-resolved analysis of -synuclein and tau at 310 K and <10 M in HEK cells at 700 MHz. We detected disordered conformations and identical patterns of cellular interactions for -synuclein wild-type and two mutants (F4A, A30P). Only the disordered N-terminus of tau was observable, even upon microtubule dismantling by colchicin. Our approach offers an excellent scalability -in signal and resolution-up to 1.2 GHz. 13C-labeling and 13C-detected NMR in live human cells are thus viable techniques for in-cell structural biology.",

    "abstract": "A coding variant in Phospholipase D3 (PLD3) increases the risk of Alzheimers disease (AD). PLD3 is a lysosomal protein, and endosomal and lysosomal abnormalities are linked to AD; however, the role of PLD3 in lysosomal homeostasis and its implications in AD remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted comprehensive studies integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and cell biology approaches. We observed significant enlargement of lysosomes in neurons lacking PLD3, accompanied by increased endocytosis and autophagy, but a decline in lysosomal proteolytic activity. Lysosomes of PLD3-deficient cells underwent proteome remodeling, manifested by an enrichment of proteins involved in lysosomal biogenesis, endocytosis and calcium signaling. Mechanistically, we discovered that PLD3 mediates TFEB/TFE3 degradation through the proteasome, and as a result, PLD3 deficiency leads to increased TFEB/TFE3 levels, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activities. Notably, variants in PLD3, e.g., V232M or K486R, do not alter its impact on TFEB/TFE3 metabolism. Transcriptomic profiling further confirmed the enrichment of transcripts involved in lysosomal biogenesis, endocytosis, autophagy, mTOR signaling and AD in response to PLD3 loss. Additionally, PLD3 ablation has synergistic effects with {beta}-amyloid in causing lysosomal abnormalities and modifying TFEB/TFE3 signaling. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PLD3 is involved in regulating lysosomal biogenesis via TFEB/TFE3 signaling, and lysosomal abnormalities resulting from PLD3 deficiency are potentially a risk factor for AD.",

Traditional approaches like particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) are limited by their reliance on single-plane two-dimensional measurements, which fail to capture the complex dynamics of CSF flow fully. To overcome these limitations, we employ Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry (AIV) to reconstruct three-dimensional velocities, infer pressure and wall shear stress, and quantify flow rates. Given the experimental nature of the data and inherent variability in biological systems, robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential. Towards this end, we have modified the baseline AIV architecture to address aleatoric uncertainty caused by noisy experimental data, enhancing our measurement refinement capabilities. We also implement UQ for the model and epistemic uncertainties arising from the governing equations and network representation. Toward this end, we test multiple governing laws, representation models, and initializations. Our approach not only advances the accuracy of CSF flow quantification but also can be adapted to other applications that use physics-informed machine learning to reconstruct fields from experimental data, providing a versatile tool for inverse problems.",

Neurological disorders, like Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, are associated with physical changes, including the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} and tau proteins, damage to the cerebral vasculature, hypertension, atrophy of the cortical gray matter, and lesions of the periventricular white matter. Alterations in the external mechanical environment of cells can trigger pathological processes, and it is known that AD causes reduced stiffness in the brain tissue during degeneration. However, there appears to be a significant lag time between microscale changes and macroscale obstruction of neurological function in the brain. Here, we present a pipeline to quantify the whole brain biomechanical environment to bridge the gap in understanding how underlying brain changes affect macroscale brain biomechanics. This pipeline enables image-based quantification of subject-specific displacement field of the whole brain to subject-specific strain, strain rate, and stress across 133 labeled functional brain regions. We have focused our development efforts on utilizing solely MRI-derived data to facilitate clinical applicability of our approach and have emphasized automation in all aspects of our methods to reduce operator dependance.

The neuropathology of AD includes the formation of extracellular amyloid-{beta} plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau, along with neuronal loss. While neuronal loss is an AD hallmark, cell-cell communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations maintains neuronal health and brain homeostasis. To study changes in cellcell communication during disease progression, we performed snRNA-sequencing of the hippocampus from female 3xTg-AD and wild-type littermates at 6 and 12 months. We inferred differential cell-cell communication between 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice across time points and between senders (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs) and receivers (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) of interest. We also assessed the downstream effects of altered glia-neuron communication using pseudobulk differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and gene regulatory analyses. We found that glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated in 12-month 3xTg-AD mice. We also identified 23 AD-associated ligand-receptor pairs that are upregulated in the 12-month-old 3xTg-AD hippocampus. Our results suggest increased AD association of interactions originating from microglia. Signaling mediators were not significantly differentially expressed but showed altered gene regulation and TF activity. Our findings indicate that altered glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated and affects the gene regulatory mechanisms in neurons of 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid-beta (A{beta}) accumulation, a hallmark pathology of Alzheimers disease (AD), precedes clinical impairment by two to three decades. However, it is unclear whether A{beta} contributes to subtle memory deficits observed during the preclinical stage. The heterogenous emergence of A{beta} deposition may selectively impact certain memory domains, which rely on distinct underlying neural circuits. In this context, we tested whether specific domains of mnemonic discrimination, a neural computation essential for episodic memory, exhibit specific deficits related to early A{beta} deposition. We tested 108 cognitively unimpaired human older adults (66% female) who underwent 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (A{beta}-PET), and a control group of 35 young adults, on a suite of mnemonic discrimination tasks taxing object, spatial, and temporal domains. We hypothesized that A{beta} pathology would be selectively associated with temporal discrimination performance due to A{beta}s propensity to accumulate in the basal frontotemporal cortex, which supports temporal processing. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found a dissociation in which generalized age-related deficits were found for object and spatial mnemonic discrimination, while A{beta}-PET levels were selectively associated with deficits in temporal mnemonic discrimination. Further, we found that higher A{beta}-PET levels in medial orbitofrontal and inferior temporal cortex, regions supporting temporal processing, were associated with greater temporal mnemonic discrimination deficits, pointing to the selective vulnerability of circuits related to temporal processing early in AD progression. These results suggest that A{beta} accumulation within basal frontotemporal regions may disrupt temporal mnemonic discrimination in preclinical AD, and may serve as a sensitive behavioral biomarker of emerging AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Although many studies have addressed the role of the amygdala in modulating long-term memory, it is not known whether weak training plus amygdala stimulation can transform a short-term memory into a remote memory. Object place recognition (OPR) memory after strong training remains hippocampus-dependent through the persistent action of PKM{zeta} for at least 6 days, but it is unknown whether weak training plus amygdala stimulation can transform short-term memory into an even longer memory, and whether such memory is stored through more persistent action of PKM{zeta} in hippocampus. We trained rats to acquire OPR and 15 min or 5 h later induced a brief pattern of electrical stimulation in basolateral amygdala (BLA). Our results reveal that a short-term memory lasting < 4 h can be converted into remote memory lasting at least 3 weeks if the BLA is activated 15 min, but not 5 h after learning. To examine how this remote memory is maintained, we injected ZIP, an inhibitor of atypical PKCs (aPKCs), PKM{zeta} and PKC{iota}/{lambda}, into either hippocampal CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Our data reveal amygdala stimulation produces consolidation into remote memory, not by persistent aPKC activation and capture by synaptic tagging processes in the hippocampal formation, but in ACC. Our data establish a powerful modulating role of the BLA in forming remote memory and open a path in the search for neurological restoration of memory, based on enhancing synaptic plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Plasma membrane protein degradation and recycling is regulated by the endolysosomal system, wherein endosomes bud from the plasma membrane into the cytosol and mature into degradative lysosomes. As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface, influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinsons to Alzheimers disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate mechanistic interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons play a pivotal role in regulating the balance of excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, the efficacy of inhibitory/excitatory synapses profoundly affects neural network processing and overall neuronal functions. Here, we describe a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced at cortical inhibitory synapses and its behavioral consequences. We show that high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) of GABAergic neurons elicit inhibitory LTP (i-LTP) in pyramidal neurons of the auditory cortex (AC). The selective activation of cholecystokinin-expressing GABA (GABACCK) neurons is essential for the formation of HFLS-induced i-LTP, rather than the classical parvalbumin (PV) neurons and somatostatin (SST) neurons. Intriguingly, i-LTP can be evoked in the AC by adding the exogenous neuropeptide CCK when PV neurons and SST neurons are selectively activated in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respectively. Additionally, we discovered that low-frequency laser stimulation (LFLS) of PV neurons paired with HFLS of GABACCK neurons potentiates the inhibitory effect of PV interneurons on pyramidal neurons, thereby generating heterosynaptic i-LTP in the AC. Notably, light activation of GABACCK neurons in CCK-Cre mice significantly attenuates sound-shock associative memory, while stimulation of PV neurons does not affect this memory in PV-Cre mice. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a critical mechanism regulating the excitation-inhibition balance and modulating learning and memory in cortical circuits. This mechanism might serve as a potential target for the treatment of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive decline. Uncovering the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in the early stages is essential to establish a treatment for AD. Recent research has proposed the hypothesis that amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) oligomers elicit an excessive glutamate release from astrocytes toward synapses through intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) elevations in astrocytes, finally resulting in neuronal dendritic spine loss. Under physiological conditions, astrocytic [Ca2+]i elevations range spatially from microdomains to network-wide propagation and temporally from milliseconds to tens of seconds. Astrocytic localized and fast [Ca2+]i elevations might correlate with glutamate release; however, the A{beta}-induced alteration of localized, fast astrocytic [Ca2+]i elevations remains unexplored.\n\nIn this study, we quantitatively investigated the A{beta} dimers-induced changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of [Ca2+]i in a primary culture of astrocytes by two-photon excitation spinning-disk confocal microscopy. The frequency of fast [Ca2+]i elevations occurring locally in astrocytes ([&le;]0.5 s, [&le;]35 {micro}m2) and [Ca2+]i event occupancy relative to cell area significantly increased after exposure to A{beta} dimers.\n\nThe effect of A{beta} dimers appeared dose-dependently above 500 nM, and these A{beta} dimers-induced [Ca2+]i elevations were primarily mediated by a metabotropic purinergic receptor (P2Y1 receptor) and Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Our findings suggest that the A{beta} dimers-induced alterations and hyperactivation of astrocytic [Ca2+]i is a candidate cellular mechanism in the early stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphHemoglobin (Hb) is well-known for transporting oxygen in red blood cells within blood vessels1. Although Hb is also present in the brain2, its role remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Hb, found in astrocytes of neurodegenerative animal models and patients, displays significant antioxidant effects through its H2O2-decomposing peroxidase activity, and a small molecule enhancer boosts this activity, reducing aberrant H2O2 and mitigating H2O2-induced neurodegeneration. To counteract the harmful effects of aberrant H2O2-production in Alzheimers disease (AD), we developed KDS12025, a blood-brain barrier (BBB)-permeable small molecule that effectively enhances the peroxidase activity of Hb by a hundredfold, especially at a low level of Hb. KDS12025 and its analogs achieve this enhancement through its electron-donating amine group. KDS12025 reduces H2O2 levels in astrocytes, exhibits neuroprotective effects, and reverses memory impairment in AD models. Gene-silencing of Hb{beta} abrogates KDS12025s impact in both culture and animal models of AD. Moreover, KDS12025 prevented the death of dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinsons disease (PD) model without altering the oxygen-transporting function of Hb. KDS12025 extended survival and improved motor function even in the severe amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model. Our findings propose Hb as a new therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, with KDS12025 emerging as a first-in-class drug candidate that enhances Hbs peroxidase activity to reduce H2O2. Boosting Hbs peroxidase activity with KDS12025 mitigates oxidative stress and alleviates neurodegeneration in AD, PD, and ALS with broad applicability for numerous oxidative-stress-driven diseases.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDrug repurposing is gaining interest due to its high cost-effectiveness, low risks, and improved patient outcomes. However, most drug repurposing methods depend on drug-disease-target semantic connections of a single drug rather than insights from drug combination data. In this study, we propose SynDRep, a novel drug repurposing tool based on enriching knowledge graphs (KG) with drug combination effects. It predicts the synergistic drug partner with a commonly prescribed drug for the target disease, leveraging graph embedding and machine learning techniques. This partner drug is then repurposed as a single agent for this disease by exploring pathways between them in KG.\n\nResultsHolE was the best-performing embedding model (with 84.58% of true predictions for all relations), and random forest emerged as the best ML model with an ROC-AUC value of 0.796. Some of our selected candidates, such as miconazole and albendazole for Alzheimers disease, have been validated through literature, while others lack either a clear pathway or literature evidence for their use for the disease of interest. Therefore, complementing SynDRep with more specialized KG, and additional training data, would enhance its efficacy and offer cost-effective and timely solutions for patients.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationSynDRep is available as an open-source Python package at https://github.com/SynDRep/SynDRep under the Apache 2.0 License.",

    "abstract": "The appearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins is a pathological hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Sleep disruption is proposed to contribute to these pathological processes and is a common early feature among neurodegenerative disorders. Synucleinopathies are a subclass of neurodegenerative conditions defined by the presence of -synuclein aggregates, which may not only enhance cell death, but also contribute to disease progression by seeding the formation of additional aggregates in neighboring cells. The mechanisms driving intercellular transmission of aggregates remains unclear. We propose that disruption of sleep-active glymphatic function, caused by loss of precise perivascular AQP4 localization, inhibits -synuclein clearance and facilitates -synuclein propagation and seeding. We examined human post-mortem frontal cortex and found that neocortical -synuclein pathology was associated with AQP4 mis-localization throughout the gray matter. Using a transgenic mouse model lacking the adapter protein -syntrophin, we observed that loss of perivascular AQP4 localization impairs the glymphatic clearance of -synuclein from intersititial to cerebrospinal fluid. Using a mouse model of -synuclein propogation, using pre-formed fibril injection, we observed that loss of perivascular AQP4 localization increased -synuclein aggregates. Our results indicate -synuclein clearance and propagation are mediated by glymphatic function and that AQP4 mis-localization observed in the presence of human synucleinopathy may contribute to the development and propagation of Lewy body pathology in conditions such as Lewy Body Dementia and Parkinsons disease.\n\nSummaryIn a human postmortem case series, we observe that neocortical Lewy body pathology is associated with mis-localization of the astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). In mice, -synuclein is cleared from the brain along perivascular pathways, while loss of perivascular AQP4 localization impairs glymphatic -synuclein clearance to the CSF. Furthermore, loss of perivascular AQP4 localization promotes the development and propagation of -synuclein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are critical innate immune cells of the brain. In vivo targeting of microglia using gene-delivery systems is crucial for studying brain physiology and developing gene therapies for neurodegenerative diseases and other brain disorders such as NeuroAIDS. Historically, microglia have been extremely resistant to transduction by viral vectors, including adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Recently, there has been some progress demonstrating the feasibility and potential of using AAV to transduce microglia after direct intraparenchymal vector injection. Data suggests that combining specific AAV capsids with microglia-specific gene expression cassettes to reduce neuron off-targeting will be key. However, no groups have developed AAV capsids for microglia transduction after intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. The ICV route of administration has advantages such as increased brain biodistribution while avoiding issues related to systemic injection. Here, we performed an in vivo selection using an AAV peptide display library that enables recovery of capsids that mediate transgene expression in microglia. Using this approach, we identified a capsid, MC5, which mediated enhanced transduction of microglia after ICV injection compared to AAV9. Furthermore, MC5 enhanced both the efficiency (85%) and specificity (93%) of transduction compared to a recently described evolved AAV9 capsid for microglia targeting after direct injection into the brain parenchyma. Exploration of the use of MC5 in a mouse models of Alzheimers disease revealed transduced microglia surrounding and within plaques. Overall, our results demonstrate that the MC5 capsid is a useful gene transfer tool to target microglia in vivo by direct and ICV routes of administration.",

    "abstract": "Metaplasticity involves changes in the state of neurons or synapses that influence their ability to generate synaptic plasticity. One form of heterosynaptic metaplasticity, known as synaptic tagging and capture (STC), has been intensively studied but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In experiments using hippocampal slices prepared from C57BL/6J mice, we have examined the role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in STC. We used a version of STC where a strong theta-burst stimulus (TBS), delivered to one set of Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway inputs to CA1, preceded a weak TBS delivered to a second independent set of inputs. We observed that, firstly, dual inhibition of mGluR1 and mGluR5, using YM 298198 and MTEP respectively, did not affect a form of protein synthesis-independent LTP (LTP1), but substantially inhibited a form of protein synthesis-dependent LTP (LTP2). Secondly, these inhibitors prevented the small heterosynaptic potentiation, which is often associated with LTP2. Thirdly, STC was abolished when these antagonists were applied either during the strong (priming) TBS or during the subsequent weak TBS at the independent pathway. It is proposed that the activation of group I mGluRs serves as a trigger for local protein synthesis both during the strong and weak TBS and, as such, are an integral part of the STC process. STC is involved in associative learning and memory, a cognitive function that is disrupted in many brain disorders including Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "In efforts to find reparative strategies for brain damage, brain-associated regulatory T cells (Tregs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Beyond their textbook immunoregulatory function, Tregs have emerged as key players in the response to brain trauma and the restoration of damaged brain tissue. Here, we are the first to describe a novel, non-canonical function of Tregs in maintaining the sealing capacity of both the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. Moreover, we identified the cytokine IL-34 as a critical determinant in this newly unveiled Treg function. Mechanistically, IL-34 exerts its influence by modulating the expression and localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in both BBB endothelial cells and choroid plexus epithelial cells, thereby reinforcing the strength of the brain barriers. Given the well-established notion of leaky brain barriers and the involvement of immunological components in neurological diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), we further demonstrate diminished IL-34 expression in Tregs derived from patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) and patients with AD and even mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Remarkably, our study reveals the potential of IL-34 treatment in reinstating the integrity of brain barriers within murine models mimicking these neurological disorders. These ground-breaking findings shed light on the intricate relationship between Tregs, IL-34, and the integrity of brain barriers. They offer novel avenues for therapeutic approaches to ameliorate brain barrier dysfunction in the context of neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) represents a promising target for inflammation-related diseases as it hydrolyzes highly anti-inflammatory epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs) to the less active corresponding diols.1 sEH harbours two distinct catalytic domains, the C-terminal hydrolase domain and the N-terminal phosphatase domain which are connected by a proline-rich linker.2 Although potent inhibitors of enzymatic activity are available for both domains, sEH-PROTACs offer the unique ability to simultaneously degrade both domains, mimicking the sEH knockout phenotype associated with beneficial effects as reducing inflammation, attenuating neuroinflammation, and delaying the progression of Alzheimers disease. Herein, we report the structure-based development of a potent sEH-PROTAC as a useful tool compound for the investigation of sEH. In order to facilitate a rapid testing of the synthesized compounds a cell-based sEH degradation assay was developed based on the HiBiT-technology. A structure-activity-relationship (SAR) investigation was performed, based on the crystal structure of previously published sEH inhibitor FL217 where we identified two possible exit vectors. We designed and synthesized a set of 24 PROTACs with varying linkers in a combinatorial manner. Furthermore, co-crystallization of sEH with two selected PROTACs allowed us to explore the binding mode and rationalize the appropriate linker length. After biological and physicochemical investigation, the most suitable PROTAC 23 was identified and applied to degrade sEH in primary human macrophages, marking the successful translation and applicability to non-artificial systems.",

    "abstract": "Lewy pathology due to alpha-synuclein (-syn) inclusions is one of the major hallmarks of Parkinson Disease (PD). A{beta}-Amyloid (A{beta}) and phosphorylated tau, pathologies usually found in Alzheimers Disease (AD), have also been implicated in PD, with over 50% of patients exhibited the co-expression of these proteins (co-pathologies). In both AD and PD postmortem tissue, neuroinflammation, the activation of microglia and resident macrophages and the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery, including T cells and monocytes, are drivers of neurodegeneration. However, how the co-expression of these pathologies contribute to the inflammatory response and overall neurodegenerative disease phenotype remains unknown. To understand how the co-expression of pathologies drives neuropathology, we developed a novel co-pathology model by stereotaxically injecting -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum, and AAV-doublemut tau virus into the entorhinal cortex, of 3-month-old J20 transgenic mice with A{beta} pathology. We analyzed immune cell populations in the brain and periphery at 3 months post-induction (3MPI). At 6MPI, neuronal loss in the hippocampus and substantia nigra pars compacta were assessed along with pathological protein deposition. At 3MPI, the co-pathology mouse model begins to exhibit enhanced pathology load in the cortex and hippocampus. There was a robust neuroinflammatory response in interconnected brain regions, including increased microglial cell number, changes in microglial activation markers, and infiltration of T cells. This was synergistic in the co-pathology model, compared to the individual models, supporting the hypothesis that these collectively may drive the progression of disease.",

    "abstract": "Mapping enhancers and target genes in disease-related cell types has provided critical insights into the functional mechanisms of genetic variants identified by genomewide association studies (GWAS). However, most existing analyses rely on bulk data or cultured cell lines, which may fail to identify cell-type-specific enhancers and target genes. Recently, single-cell multimodal data measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cells have enabled the inference of enhancer-gene pairs in a cell-type-specific and context-specific manner. However, this task is challenged by the datas high sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of enhancer-gene pairs. To address these challenges, we propose scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p-values. In systematic analyses of blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power with greater reproducibility across independent datasets and stronger consistency with orthogonal data modalities. Meanwhile, its computational cost is less than 1% of existing methods. When applied to single-cell multimodal data from postmortem brain samples from Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and controls, scMultiMap gave the highest heritability enrichment in microglia and revealed new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of AD GWAS variants in microglia.",

    "abstract": "A thermoregulatory decline occurs with age due to changes in muscle mass, vasoconstriction, and metabolism that lowers core body temperature (Tc). Although lower Tc is a biomarker of successful aging, we have previously shown this worsens cognitive performance in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD) [1]. We hypothesized that elevating Tc with thermotherapy would improve metabolism and cognition in APP/PS1 mice. From 6-12 months of age, male and female APP/PS1 and C57BL/6 mice were chronically housed at 23 or 30{degrees}C. At 12 months of age, mice were assayed for insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and spatial cognition. Plasma, hippocampal, and peripheral (adipose, hepatic, and skeletal muscle) samples were procured postmortem and tissue-specific markers of amyloid accumulation, metabolism, and inflammation were assayed. Chronic 30{degrees}C exposure increased Tc in all groups except female APP/PS1 mice. All mice receiving thermotherapy had either improved glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity, but the underlying processes responsible for these effects varied across sexes. In males, glucose regulation was influenced predominantly by hormonal signaling in plasma and skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 expression, whereas in females, this was modulated at the tissue level. Thermotherapy improved spatial navigation in male C57BL/6 and APP/PS1 mice, with the later attributed to reduced hippocampal soluble amyloid-{beta} (A{beta})42. Female APP/PS1 mice exhibited worse spatial memory recall after chronic thermotherapy. Together, the data highlights the metabolic benefits of passive thermotherapy, but future studies are needed to determine therapeutic benefits for those with AD.",

Evidence shows that impaired somatostatin (SST) expression, particularly in SST-expressing GABAergic neurons, significantly contributes to AD-related pathophysiology and may increase cognitive burden. Additionally, SST+ interneurons in cortical layers and the hippocampus inhibit the dendrites of excitatory neurons, primarily through 5-GABAA receptors involved in cognitive regulation. Leveraging the potential of a newly developed small molecule that targets the 5-GABAA receptors via positive allosteric modulation (5-PAM), we aim to assess its effects on tau phosphorylation-related neuronal morphology, cognitive deficits and protein expression.\n\nMethodsIn the PS19 transgenic mouse mode, we administered the 5-PAM, GL-II-73, either acutely or chronically at 3 and 6 months. We assessed spatial working memory using the Y-maze. Golgi staining analyzed dendritic morphology in chronically exposed mice to 5-PAM. Western blotting was used to quantify p-Tau and Tau expression.\n\nResults5-PAM effectively reverses spatial working memory deficits induced by tau phosphorylation both acutely and chronically. Chronic treatment at 3and 6 months mitigates tau-induced loss of spine density. However, 5-PAM does not directly influence p-Tau levels, suggesting cognitive and neurotrophic benefits of GL-II-73s are independent of Tau burden.\n\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate the potential for both symptomatic and disease-modifying effects, highlighting the promise of 5-GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulation as a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing cognitive deficits associated with tau phosphorylation in AD pathology.",

Often referred to as type 3 diabetes, Alzheimers disease (AD) shares a close association with hyperglycemia and insulin dysregulation. Despite this, anti-diabetic medications have proven beneficial in reducing cognitive impairment induced by T2D. Previous research, including our own, has highlighted the dysregulation of Cdk5 activity in both T2D and AD, with downstream consequences contributing to the progression of pathophysiological changes in both disorders. Therefore, targeting the kinase Cdk5 may offer a more effective approach to treating T2D and cognitive deterioration. In our study, we present evidence supporting Cdk5 as a significant mediator between T2D and cognitive decline. Through the screening of the KINACore library, we identified novel brain-penetrant Cdk5 inhibitors, BLINK11 and BLINK15. Our study further validated the efficacy of these inhibitors in a high-fat diet-induced T2D model, demonstrating their rescue effects on T2D pathogenesis, including blood glucose levels, obesity, and cognitive impairment as assessed through behavioral studies.

    "abstract": "Tauopathy is a spectrum of diseases characterized by fibrillary tau aggregate formation in neurons and glial cells in the brain. Tau aggregation originates in the brainstem and entorhinal cortex and then spreads throughout the brain in Alzheimers disease (AD), which is the most prevalent type of tauopathy. Understanding the mechanism by which locally developed tau pathology propagates throughout the brain is crucial for comprehending AD pathogenesis. Therefore, a novel model of tau pathology that artificially induces tau aggregation in targeted cells at specific times is essential. This study describes a novel optogenetic module, OptoTau, which is a human tau with the P301L mutation fused with a photosensitive protein CRY2olig, inducing various forms of tau according to the temporal pattern of blue light illumination pattern. Continuous blue light illumination for 12 h to Neuro2a cells that stably express OptoTau (OptoTauKI cells) formed clusters along microtubules, many of which eventually accumulated in aggresomes.\n\nConversely, methanol-resistant tau aggregation was formed when alternating light exposure and darkness in 30-min cycles for 8 sets per day were repeated over 8 days. Methanol-resistant tau was induced more rapidly by repeating 5-min illumination followed by 25-min darkness over 24 h. These results indicate that OptoTau induced various tau aggregation stages based on the temporal pattern of blue light exposure. Thus, this technique exhibits potential as a novel approach to developing specific tau aggregation in targeted cells at desired time points.\n\nSignificanceThis study developed an approach to manipulate tau aggregation in a blue light-dependent manner using cells that stably express OptoTau, which is an optogenetic tool based on the CRY2olig module. Tau accumulation in aggresomes or stable tau aggregation were selectively induced by blue light illumination conditions. These results are crucial as they provide a new technological basis for establishing a singular point of tau aggregation in specific targeted cells at a particular time.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the formation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that leads to decreased quality of life due to behavioral, motor, and cognitive impairments. Due to the widespread pathological nature of AD, many brain regions are affected by amyloid beta plaques including regions important for vision such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus which is critical for relaying signals from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Using a wide range of techniques including electrophysiological approaches, in vivo and ex vivo imaging methods, and immunohistochemistry in a mouse model with progressing amyloidosis (5xFAD), the goal of this study was to determine whether AD-like pathology disrupts neuronal and synaptic structure and function in the visual system. In vivo electroretinogram recordings revealed photoreceptor dysfunction in the 6- and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice, while optical coherence tomography indicated no changes in retinal thickness. In the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the rodent homolog of the primate LGN, we identified decreased densities of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals and fewer thalamocortical (TC) neuron cell bodies. No detectable deficits in excitatory synaptic function or TC neuron dendritic structure were seen in the dLGN, and reflexive visual behavior was also found to be normal in the 5xFAD mice. These results indicate relatively modest amyloid-triggered dysfunction in these stages of the visual system suggesting that amyloid beta plaque formation may play only a small role in the visual system dysfunction seen in AD patients. These results may also point to potential compensatory mechanisms that preserve function of visual pathways in the 5xFAD visual system.",

    "abstract": "The sheer complexity of the brain has complicated our ability to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its function in health and disease. Genome-wide association studies have uncovered genetic variants associated with specific neurological phenotypes and diseases. In addition, single-cell transcriptomics have provided molecular descriptions of specific brain cell types and the changes they undergo during disease. Although these approaches provide a giant leap forward towards understanding how genetic variation can lead to functional changes in the brain, they do not establish molecular mechanisms. To address this need, we developed a 3D co-culture system termed iAssembloids (induced multi-lineage assembloids) that enables the rapid generation of homogenous neuron-glia spheroids. We characterize these iAssembloids with immunohistochemistry and single-cell transcriptomics and combine them with large-scale CRISPRi-based screens. In our first application, we ask how glial and neuronal cells interact to control neuronal death and survival. Our CRISPRi-based screens identified that GSK3{beta} inhibits the protective NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response in the presence of reactive oxygen species elicited by high neuronal activity, which was not previously found in 2D monoculture neuron screens. We also apply the platform to investigate the role of APOE-{varepsilon}4, a risk variant for Alzheimers Disease, in its effect on neuronal survival. We find that APOE-{varepsilon}4-expressing astrocytes may promote more neuronal activity as compared to APOE-{varepsilon}3-expressing astrocytes. This platform expands the toolbox for the unbiased identification of mechanisms of cell-cell interactions in brain health and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMedin is one of the most common amyloidogenic proteins and accumulates in the vasculature with aging. Vascular medin accumulation is associated with Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia and aortic aneurysms. Medin impairs smooth muscle-dependent vasodilation in isolated human brain cerebral arteries. The role of medin in vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) activation is unknown. We aim to evaluate the effects of medin on human brain VSMC activation.\n\nMethodsVSMCs were exposed to physiologic doses of medin (0.5, 1 and 5 {micro}M) without or with small molecule nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF{kappa}B) inhibitor RO106-9920 (10 {micro}M) for 20 hours. Polymerase chain reaction, Western blot/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to quantify gene and protein expressions/secretions, respectively, of pro-inflammatory factors (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1) and structural and enzyme proteins associated with VSMC phenotypic transformation (smooth muscle actin alpha 2 (ACTA2), myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)).\n\nResultsMedin exposure increased VSMC gene expression and protein secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 (protein secretion 46.0{+/-}12.8x, 20.2{+/-}4.1x and 8.7{+/-}3.1x, respectively, medin 5 {micro}M versus vehicle, all p<0.05). There was no change in gene or protein expressions of ACTA2, MYH11 and NOX4. Co-treatment with RO106-9920 reduced medin-induced increases in IL-6 and IL-8 and a trend towards reduced MCP-1 secretion.\n\nConclusionsMedin induced pro-inflammatory activation of human brain VSMCs that is mediated, at least in part, by NF{kappa}B. Acute medin treatment did not alter structural proteins involved in VSMC phenotypic transformation. The findings support medin as a potential novel mediator of and therapeutic target for vascular aging pathology.",

    "abstract": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that plays an important role in modulating axonal microtubules in neurons. Intracellular tau aggregates are found in a broad class of disorders, including Alzheimers disease, termed tauopathies. Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein, and its structural disorder appears to be critical to its microtubule-related functions. Tubulin binding sites are found in taus proline-rich region (PRR), microtubule binding repeats (MTBR: R1-R4), and pseudo-repeat, R'. While many post-translational modifications have been identified on tau, phosphorylation sites, which both regulate tubulin dimer and microtubule interactions and are correlated with disease, cluster with high frequency within the PRR. Here, we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and structural mass spectrometry techniques to characterize the impact of phosphomimic mutations in the PRR on tubulin dimer binding and probe the structure of the PRR-tubulin dimer complex. We find that phosphomimics cumulatively diminish tubulin dimer binding and slow microtubule polymerization. Additionally, we map two [~]15 residue regions of the PRR as primary tubulin dimer binding sites and propose a model in which PRR enhances lateral interactions between tubulin dimers, complementing the longitudinal interactions observed for MTBR. Together these measurements provide insight into the previously overlooked relevance of taus PRR in functional interactions with tubulin.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/614010v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@360dd3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c5d75aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd76eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cb433c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neurovascular coupling, linking neuronal activity to cerebral blood flow, is essential for brain function and underpins functional brain imaging. Whereas mechanisms involved in vasodilation are well-documented, those controlling vasoconstriction remain overlooked. This study unravels the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells elicit arteriole vasoconstriction. Using patch-clamp recording, vascular and Ca2+ imaging in mouse cortical slices, we show that strong optogenetic activation of layer II/III pyramidal cells induces vasoconstriction, correlating with firing frequency and somatic Ca2+ increase. Ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological investigations indicate that this vasoconstriction predominantly recruits prostaglandin E2 through the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway, and activation of EP1 and EP3 receptors. We also present evidence that specific interneurons releasing neuropeptide Y, and astrocytes, through 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, contribute to this process. By revealing the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells lead to vasoconstriction, our findings shed light on the complex regulation of neurovascular coupling.\n\nSignificance statementCerebral blood flow is tightly controlled by neuronal activity, a process termed neurovascular coupling which serves as the physiological basis for functional brain imaging widely used to map neuronal activity in health and diseases. While the prevailing view links increased neuronal activity with enhanced blood perfusion, our data suggest that elevated neuronal activity can also reduce cerebral blood flow. By optically controlling the activity of pyramidal cells, we demonstrate that these excitatory neurons induce vasoconstriction when their action potential firing is increased by releasing glutamate and lipid messengers. These findings update the interpretation of functional brain imaging signals and help to better understand the etiopathogenesis of epilepsy and Alzheimers disease, in which hyperactivity, hypoperfusion and cognitive deficits overlap.",

    "abstract": "Sleep alterations are hallmarks of prodromal Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), with fundamental neuropathological processes of both diseases showing susceptibility of change upon deep sleep modulation. However, promising pharmacological deep sleep enhancement results are hindered by specificity and scalability issues, thus advocating for noninvasive slow-wave activity (SWA) boosting methods to investigate the links between deep sleep and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, we have recently introduced mouse closed-loop auditory stimulation (mCLAS), which is able to successfully boost SWA during deep sleep in neurodegeneration models. Here, we aim at further exploring mCLAS acute effect onto disease-specific sleep and wake alterations in AD (Tg2576) and PD (M83) mice. We found that mCLAS adaptively rescues pathological sleep and wake traits depending on the disease-specific impairments observed at baseline in each model. Notably, in AD mice mCLAS significantly increases NREM long/short bout ratio, decreases vigilance state distances by decreasing transition velocities and increases the percentage of cumulative time spent in NREM sleep in the last three hours of the dark period. Contrastingly, in PD mice mCLAS significantly decreases NREM sleep consolidation, by potentiating faster and more frequent transitions between vigilance states, decreases average EMG muscle tone during REM sleep and increases alpha power in WAKE and NREM sleep. Overall, our results indicate that mCLAS selectively prompts an acute alleviation of neurodegeneration-associated sleep and wake phenotypes, by either potentiating sleep consolidation and vigilance state stability in AD or by rescuing bradysomnia and decreasing cortical hyperexcitability in PD. Further experiments assessing the electrophysiological, neuropathological and behavioural long-term effects of mCLAS in neurodegeneration may majorly impact the clinical establishment of sleep-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Identifying gene expression differences in heterogeneous tissues across experimental or observational conditions is a fundamental biological task, enabled by single-cell assays such as multi-condition sc-RNA-seq. Current data analysis approaches divide the constituent cells into clusters meant to represent cell types, and identify differentially expressed genes for each cluster. However, such discrete categorization tends to be an unsatisfactory model of the underlying biology. Use of more gradual representations of cell type or cell state promises higher statistical power, better usability and better interpretability. Here, we introduce Latent Embedding Multivariate Regression (LEMUR), a generative model that enables differential expression analysis using a continuous low-dimensional latent space parameterization of cell type and state diversity. It operates without, or before, commitment to discrete categorization. LEMUR (1) integrates data from the different conditions, (2) predicts how each cells gene expression would change as a function of the conditions and its position in latent space, and (3) for each gene, identifies compact neighborhoods of cells with consistent differential expression. Unlike statically defined clusters, these neighborhoods adapt to the underlying gene expression changes. We assess LEMURs performance on a compendium of single-cell datasets and show applications to the identification of tumor subpopulations with distinct drug responses, the interplay between cell state and developmental time in zebrafish embryos, and the discovery of cell state x environment interactions in a spatial single-cell study of plaques in Alzheimers disease. LEMUR is broadly applicable as a first-line analysis approach to multi-condition sc-RNA-seq data.\n\nSoftware availabilityhttps://bioconductor.org/packages/lemur\n\nContactconstantin.ahlmann@embl.de",

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of A{beta} on fear memory and functional connectome measures in male and female mice. Middle-aged (9-11mo) double transgenic APP-PS1 mice and age and sex-matched controls were tested on a fear conditioning protocol and then imaged at 11.1 Tesla. Brains were harvested and processed for analysis of A{beta} plaques and Iba1 immunolabeling in neocortical areas, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala. Additional RNA sequencing data from separate age, strain, and sex matched mice were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted gene co-expression networks. In both male and female mice, we observed increased functional connectivity in a dorsal striatal/amygdala network as a result of A{beta}. Increased functional connectivity within this network was matched by increases in APP gene expression, A{beta} and Iba1 immunolabeling, and an upregulated cluster of DEGs involved in the immune response. Conversely, the network measure representing node  hubness, eigenvector centrality, was increased in prefrontal cortical brain regions, but only in female APP-PS1 mice. This female specific-effect of amyloid was associated with downregulation of a cluster of DEGs involved in cortical and striatal GABA transmission, anxiogenic responses, and motor activity, in female APP-PS1 mice, but not males. Our results contribute to a growing literature linking between A{beta}, immune activation and functional network connectivity. Furthermore, our results reveal effects of A{beta} on gene expression patterns in female mice that may contribute to amyloidosis-induced dysregulation of non-cognitive circuitry.\n\nHighlights- Amyloidosis was associated with increased functional connectivity in a dorsal striatal/amygdala network, an effect paralleled by increased differentially expressed genes involved in the immune response.\n- Amyloidosis increased eigenvector centrality, a network measure reportedly altered in Alzheimers disease, but this effect was only observed in female mice.\n- In female mice, amyloidosis downregulated a cluster of differentially expressed genes known to play roles in GABAergic and dopaminergic signaling, anxiogenic responses and motor activity.",

While deep learning models have shown success in reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of predicted brain age, concerns about robust and accurate generalization in new data limit their clinical applicability. The large number of trainable parameters, combined with limited medical imaging training data, contribute to this challenge, often resulting in a generalization gap where there is a significant discrepancy between model performance on training data versus unseen data.\n\nIn this study, we assess a deep model, SFCN-reg, based on the VGG-16 architecture, and address the generalization gap through comprehensive preprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and model regularization. Using training data from the UK Biobank, we demonstrate substantial improvements in model performance. Specifically, our approach reduces the generalization MAE by 44% (from 5.25 to 2.96 years) in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and by 22% (from 4.35 to 3.40 years) in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle dataset. Furthermore, we achieve a 29% reduction in scan-rescan error (from 0.86 to 0.61 years) while enhancing the models robustness to registration errors. Feature importance maps highlight anatomical regions used to predict age.\n\nThese results highlight the critical role of high-quality preprocessing and robust training techniques in improving accuracy and narrowing the generalization gap, both necessary steps towards the clinical use of brain age prediction models.

    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is an early site of pathology in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), and it undergoes catastrophic degeneration later in both disorders. Dysregulation of the LC is thought to contribute to prodromal symptoms of AD and PD such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, while frank LC-NE loss promotes cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms responsible for its selective vulnerability are unknown. The LC is among the only structures in the brain that produces appreciable amounts of neuromelanin (NM), a dark cytoplasmic pigment. It has been proposed that NM initially plays a protective role by sequestering toxic catecholamine metabolites and heavy metals, but may become harmful during aging as it overwhelms cellular machinery and is released during neurodegeneration. Rodents do not naturally produce NM, limiting the study of causal relationships between NM and LC pathology. Adapting a viral-mediated approach for expression of human tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for peripheral melanin production, we successfully promoted pigmentation in mouse LC neurons that recapitulates key ultrastructural features of endogenous NM found in primates. Pigment expression results in LC neuron hyperactivity, reduced tissue NE levels, transcriptional changes, and novelty-induced anxiety phenotypes as early as 1-week post-injection. By 6-10 weeks, NM accumulation is associated with severe LC neuron neurodegeneration and microglial engulfment of the pigment granules, while the anxiety-like behavior is abated. These phenotypes are reminiscent of LC dysfunction and cell death in AD and PD, validating this model for studying the consequences of pigment accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease.",

The soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2) exhibits neuroprotective effects in AD, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Moreover, differences in ligand binding between TREM2 and sTREM2, which have major implications for their roles in AD pathology, remain unexplained. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted the most computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations to date of (s)TREM2, exploring their interactions with key damage- and lipoprotein-associated phospholipids and the impact of the AD-risk mutation R47H. Our results demonstrate that the flexible stalk domain of sTREM2 serves as the molecular basis for differential ligand binding between sTREM2 and TREM2, facilitated by its role in stabilizing the Ig-like domain and altering the accessibility of canonical ligand binding sites. We identified a novel ligand binding site on sTREM2, termed the  Expanded Surface 2, which emerges due to competitive binding of the stalk with the Ig-like domain. Additionally, we observed that the stalk domain itself functions as a site for ligand binding, with increased binding in the presence of R47H. This suggests that sTREM2s neuroprotective role in AD may, at least in part, arise from the stalk domains ability to rescue dysfunctional ligand binding caused by AD-risk mutations. Lastly, our findings indicate that R47H-induced dysfunction in membrane-bound TREM2 may result from both diminished ligand binding due to restricted complementarity-determining region 2 loop motions and an impaired ability to differentiate between ligands, proposing a novel mechanism for loss-of-function. In summary, these results provide valuable insights into the role of sTREM2 in AD pathology, laying the groundwork for the design of new therapeutic approaches targeting (s)TREM2 in AD.",

To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted the most computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations to date of (s)TREM2, exploring their interactions with key damage- and lipoprotein-associated phospholipids and the impact of the AD-risk mutation R47H. Our results demonstrate that the flexible stalk domain of sTREM2 serves as the molecular basis for differential ligand binding between sTREM2 and TREM2, facilitated by its role in stabilizing the Ig-like domain and altering the accessibility of canonical ligand binding sites. We identified a novel ligand binding site on sTREM2, termed the  Expanded Surface 2, which emerges due to competitive binding of the stalk with the Ig-like domain. Additionally, we observed that the stalk domain itself functions as a site for ligand binding, with increased binding in the presence of R47H. This suggests that sTREM2s neuroprotective role in AD may, at least in part, arise from the stalk domains ability to rescue dysfunctional ligand binding caused by AD-risk mutations. Lastly, our findings indicate that R47H-induced dysfunction in membrane-bound TREM2 may result from both diminished ligand binding due to restricted complementarity-determining region 2 loop motions and an impaired ability to differentiate between ligands, proposing a novel mechanism for loss-of-function. In summary, these results provide valuable insights into the role of sTREM2 in AD pathology, laying the groundwork for the design of new therapeutic approaches targeting (s)TREM2 in AD.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a crucial role in brain aging due to their involvement in bioenergetics, neuroinflammation and brain steroid synthesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. We investigated changes in the activities of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in normally aging baboon brains and determined how these changes relate to donor sex, morning cortisol levels, and walking speed. Using a novel approach, we assessed mitochondrial bioenergetics from frozen prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissues from a large cohort (60 individuals) of well-characterized aging baboons (6.6-22.8 years, approximately equivalent to 26.4-91.2 human years). Aging was associated with a decline in mitochondrial ETC complexes in the PFC, which was more pronounced when activities were normalized for citrate synthase activity, suggesting that the decline in respiration is predominantly driven by changes in the specific activity of individual complexes rather than changes in mitochondrial number. Moreover, when donor sex was used as a covariate, we found that mitochondrial respiration was preserved with age in females, whereas males showed significant loss of ETC activity with age. Males had higher activities of each individual ETC complex and greater lactate dehydrogenase activity relative to females. Circulating cortisol levels correlated only with complex II-linked respiration in males. We also observed a robust positive predictive relationship between walking speed and respiration linked to complexes I, III, and IV in males but not in females. This data reveals a previously unknown link between aging and bioenergetics across multiple tissues linking frailty and bioenergetic function. This study highlights a potential molecular mechanism for sexual dimorphism in brain resilience and suggests that in males changes in PFC bioenergetics contribute to reduced motor function with age.",

    "abstract": "Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between brain oscillations of different frequencies plays a fundamental role in neural processing, and phase-dependent neuromodulation has emerged as a promising strategy to modulate PAC. In the hippocampus, theta-gamma PAC is critically involved in memory-related functions and information propagation. Computational models provide a valuable platform for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying phase- dependent effects, bypassing the limitations of in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this study, we extended a previously published computational model of the hippocampal CA3 region using the NEURON and Python environments. A closed-loop autoregressive (AR) forward prediction model was employed to sample the networks local field potential (LFP) in real time, enabling the precise calculation of phase-locked stimulus time points. Our results demonstrated the successful delivery of phase-locked current injections to all neuronal populations at both the peak and trough of theta oscillations. Phase-specific alterations in the theta band were observed during stimulation, along with enhanced theta-gamma coupling induced by peak-phase stimulation. Single neuron activity analysis highlighted the critical role of oriens lacunosum- moleculare (OLM) cells in modulating phase-dependent network dynamics. These findings underscore the potential of closed-loop stimulation systems to modulate PAC, with significant implications for the treatment of neurological disorders characterized by abnormal oscillatory activity, such as Alzheimers disease and other memory-related disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementBy employing a computational model of the hippocampal CA3 region, we reveal the ability of the phase-dependent stimulation technique to modulate phase-amplitude coupling, a critical mechanism in memory and information processing. Our findings highlight the importance of precise phase-locked stimulation and the key role of specific interneurons in regulating network dynamics. These insights lay the groundwork for developing targeted neuromodulation therapies to restore normal oscillatory patterns in the brain, with promising implications for treating memory-related neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Understanding complex interactions in biomedical networks is crucial for advancements in biomedicine, but traditional link prediction (LP) methods are limited in capturing this complexity. Representation-based learning techniques improve prediction accuracy by mapping nodes to low-dimensional embeddings, yet they often struggle with interpretability and scalability. We present BioPathNet, a novel graph neural network framework based on the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), addressing these limitations through path-based reasoning for LP in biomedical knowledge graphs. Unlike node-embedding frameworks, BioPathNet learns representations between node pairs by considering all relations along paths, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability. This allows visualization of influential paths and facilitates biological validation. BioPathNet leverages a background regulatory graph (BRG) for enhanced message passing and uses stringent negative sampling to improve precision. In evaluations across various LP tasks, such as gene function annotation, drug-disease indication, synthetic lethality, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction prediction, BioPathNet consistently outperformed shallow node embedding methods, relational graph neural networks and task-specific state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robust performance and versatility. Our study predicts novel drug indications for diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Alzheimers, validated by medical experts and clinical trials. We also identified new synthetic lethality gene pairs and regulatory interactions involving lncRNAs and target genes, confirmed through literature reviews. BioPathNets interpretability will enable researchers to trace prediction paths and gain molecular insights, making it a valuable tool for drug discovery, personalized medicine and biology in general.",

    "abstract": "The most common approach for estimating the spatial resolution of PET images in multi-center studies typically uses Hoffman phantom data as a surrogate. Specifically, the phantom-based matching resolution approach assumes that scanned phantom PET images are well approximated by a ground truth, noise-free digital phantom convolved with a Gaussian kernel of unknown size. The size of the kernel is then estimated by an exhaustive search on the amount of blurring needed to match the smoothed digital phantom to a particular scanned phantom image. Unfortunately, Hoffman phantom images may not always be readily available, and phantom-based approaches may yield sub-optimal results. We propose a new, computational approach that allows estimation of spatial resolution directly from the PET image itself. We generalized the so-called logarithmic intensity plots method to the 3D case to perform a spatial resolution estimation in both axial and in-plane directions of the PET images. The proposed approach was applied to two different cohorts. The first cohort consisted of [18F]florbetapir amyloid PET images and matching phantoms coming from a Phase II clinical trial and includes different scanner models and/or orientation and grid reconstructions. The second cohort included {beta}-amyloid, FDG and tau PET images from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We obtained in-plane and axial resolution estimators that vary between 3.5 mm and 8.5 mm for both PET and matching phantom images. In both cases, we obtained small across-subject variability in groups of images sharing the same PET scanner model and reconstruction parameters. For human PET images, we also obtained a strong cross-tracer and longitudinal consistency in the spatial resolution estimators. Our novel approach does not only eliminate the need for surrogate brain phantom data, but also provides a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of tracers and other image modalities, such as SPECT.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the residential immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibited in multiple states from resting to activated, play a significant role in neurogenesis, myelination, synaptic transmission, immune surveillance, and neuroinflammation. The aggravated inflammatory response by microglia triggers the generation of superoxide, which often causes the degeneration of neurons, leading to the development of Parkinsons and Alzheimers. The oxidative stress is key to many neurological disorders, often regulated by many genes. The terminal neutralization of oxidative stress is mediated by NADPH and glutathione. The cytosolic NADPH level is majorly contributed by a key enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The deficiency of G6PD is associated with hemolytic anemia, diabetes, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurological disorders. Our recent study indicated that G6PD deficiency decreases cytosolic NADPH levels and alters redox homeostasis and lysosomal function in microglia. Therefore, replenishment of NADPH is crucial for targeting G6PD deficiency-mediated microglial dysfunctions. This research promotes alternate metabolic pathways by targeting the expression and activity of enzymes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and malic enzyme 1 (ME1), which are responsible for cytoplasmic NADPH production. Metabolites like citric and malic acid supplementation promote NADPH production and reduce microglial oxidative stress. Additionally, using another group of small-molecule metabolites, such as dieckol and resveratrol, enhances the expression of IDH1 and ME1 enzymes to resolve potential tissue heterogeneity. Finally, combining these metabolites supplementation increased NADPH production and restored redox homeostasis and lysosomal function in G6PD deficient microglia, indicating their further use as potential therapeutics against G6PD deficiency disorders.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/607918v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11f0df3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cccf25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133a3c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145bac1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Iron is critical for neuronal activity and metabolism, and iron dysregulation alters these functions in age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction, memory loss and decreased cognitive function. AD patients exhibit elevated iron levels in the brain compared to age-matched non-AD individuals. However, the degree to which iron overload contributes to AD pathogenesis is unclear. Here, we evaluated the involvement of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death process, in mediating AD-like pathologies in C. elegans. Results showed that iron accumulation occurred prior to the loss of neuronal function as worms age. In addition, energetic imbalance was an early event in iron-induced loss of neuronal function. Furthermore, the loss of neuronal function was, in part, due to increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative damage, ultimately resulting in ferroptotic cell death. The mitochondrial redox environment and ferroptosis were modulated by pharmacologic processes that exacerbate or abolish iron accumulation both in wild-type worms and worms with increased levels of neuronal amyloid beta (A{beta}). However, neuronal A{beta} worms were more sensitive to ferroptosis-mediated neuronal loss, and this increased toxicity was ameliorated by limiting the uptake of ferrous iron through knockout of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). In addition, DMT1 knockout completely suppressed phenotypic measures of A{beta} toxicity with age. Overall, our findings suggest that iron-induced ferroptosis alters the mitochondrial redox environment to drive oxidative damage when neuronal A{beta} is overexpressed. DMT1 knockout abolishes neuronal A{beta}-associated pathologies by reducing neuronal iron uptake.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEnergetic imbalance is an early event in iron-induced loss of neuronal function\nC_LIO_LINeuronal A{beta} increases susceptibility to ferroptosis mediated oxidative damage\nC_LIO_LIDivalent metal transporter 1 knockout protects against iron-induced oxidative damage and ferroptosis\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/607074v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@927aaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b121forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d2d6aforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10cb797_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

They exhibit many and diverse functions, such as but not limited to, growth factor signaling, immune and inflammatory response, protein quality control, and parasitic invasion. Human rhomboid protease RHBDL4 has been demonstrated to play a critical role in removing misfolded proteins from the Endoplasmic Reticulum and is implicated in severe diseases such as various cancers and Alzheimers disease. Therefore, RHBDL4 is expected to constitute an important therapeutic target for such devastating diseases. Despite its critical role in many biological processes, the enzymatic properties of RHBDL4 remain largely unknown. To enable a comprehensive characterization of RHBDL4s kinetics, catalytic parameters, substrate specificity, and binding modality we expressed and purified recombinant RHBDL4, and employed it in a Forster Resonance Energy Transfer-based cleavage assay. Until now, kinetic studies have been limited mostly to bacterial rhomboid proteases. Our in vitro platform offers a new method for studying RHBDL4s enzymatic function and substrate preferences. Furthermore, we developed and tested potential inhibitors using our assay and successfully identifying peptidyl -ketoamide inhibitors of RHBDL4 that are highly effective against recombinant RHBDL4. We utilize ensemble docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the binding modality of substrate-derived peptides bound to RHBDL4. Our analysis focused on key interactions and dynamic movements within RHBDL4s active site that contributed to binding stability, offering valuable insights for optimizing the non-prime side of RHBDL4 ketoamide inhibitors. In summary, our study offers fundamental insights into RHBDL4s catalytic activities and substrate preferences, laying the foundation for downstream applications such as drug inhibitor screenings and structure-function studies, which will enable the identification of lead drug compounds for RHBDL4.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of individualized alpha frequency tACS (IAF-tACS) on FC within the default mode network (DMN) in healthy individuals, particularly focusing on the precuneus (PCU) as a major hub within the network.\n\nMaterials and Methods27 healthy participants were recruited, which underwent a 20-minute IAF-tACS session and three magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings: two pre-stimulation and one post-stimulation. Participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation or sham group. FC was evaluated through the corrected imaginary phase locking value (ci-PLV) and leakage corrected amplitude envelope correlation (AEC-c). Statistical analyses compared both Pre-Post FC ratio between groups through ratio t-tests and intragroup FC changes through repeated measures t-tests, with FDR correction applied to account for multiple comparisons. An additional analysis simulated the influence of the cortical folding on the effect of tACS over FC.\n\nResultsIAF-tACS significantly decreased AEC-c within the PCU and DMN in the stimulation group compared to the sham group, especially influencing antero-posterior links between hubs of the DMN. No significant changes were observed in ci-PLV connectivity metrics. Negative correlations were found between AEC-c FC changes and power alterations in posterior DMN areas, suggesting a complex interaction between cortical folding and electric field direction.\n\nConclusionsAgainst our initial hypothesis, IAF-tACS reduced FC in the DMN, possibly due to phase disparities introduced by cortical gyrification. These findings suggest that tACS might modulate FC in a more complex manner than previously thought, highlighting the need for further research into the personalized application of neuromodulation techniques, as well as its potential therapeutic implications for conditions like Alzheimers disease.",

In this domain, digital brain atlases are essential for subject-specific segmentation of anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and spatial comparison of neuroanatomy from different subjects in a common coordinate frame. High-resolution, digital atlases derived from histology (e.g., Allen atlas [7], BigBrain [13], Julich [15]), are currently the state of the art and provide exquisite 3D cytoarchitectural maps, but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain. Here we present NextBrain, a next - generation probabilistic atlas of human brain anatomy built from serial 3D histology and corresponding highly granular delineations of five whole brain hemispheres. We developed AI techniques to align and reconstruct [~]10,000 histological sections into coherent 3D volumes with joint geometric constraints (no overlap or gaps between sections), as well as to semi-automatically trace the boundaries of 333 distinct anatomical ROIs on all these sections. Comprehensive delineation on multiple cases enabled us to build the first probabilistic histological atlas of the whole human brain. Further, we created a companion Bayesian tool for automated segmentation of the 333 ROIs in any in vivo or ex vivo brain MRI scan using the NextBrain atlas. We showcase two applications of the atlas: automated segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of Alzheimers disease and healthy brain ageing based on [~]4,000 publicly available in vivo MRI scans. We publicly release: the raw and aligned data (including an online visualisation tool); the probabilistic atlas; the segmentation tool; and ground truth delineations for a 100 m isotropic ex vivo hemisphere (that we use for quantitative evaluation of our segmentation method in this paper).

Recent advancements in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) techniques tailored for FFPE tissues have demonstrated their feasibility. However, isolation of high-quality nuclei from FFPE tissue with current methods remains challenging due to RNA cross-linking. We, therefore, proposed a novel strategy for the preparation of high-fidelity nuclei from FFPE samples, cryogenic enzymatic dissociation (CED) method, and performed snRandom-seq (snCED-seq) for polyformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed and FFPE brains to verify its applicability. The method is compatible with both PFA-based and FFPE brains or other organs with less hands-on time and lower reagent costs, and produced 10 times more nuclei than the homogenate method, without secondary degradation of RNA, and maximized the retention of RNA molecules within nuclei. snCED-seq shows 1.5-2 times gene and UMI numbers per nucleus, higher gene detection sensitivity and RNA coverage, and a minor rate of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, compared with the nuclei from traditional method. The correlation gene expression of nucleus from the post-fixed and the frozen sample can be up to 94 %, and the gene expression of our nuclei was more abundant. Moreover, we applied snCED-seq to cellular heterogeneity study of the specimen on Alzheimers Disease (AD) to demonstrate a pilot application. Scarce Cajal Retzius cells in older mice were robustly detected in our data, and we successfully identified two subpopulations of disease-associated in astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Meanwhile, we found that most cell types are affected at the transcriptional level by AD pathology, and there is a disease susceptibility gene set that affects these cell types similarly. Our method provides powerful nuclei for snRNA-seq studies for FFPE specimens, and even helps to reveal multi-omics information of clinical samples.",

Biological drivers of RHI-related neurodegeneration are not well understood. We interrogated the plasma proteome in aging adults with prior RHI compared to healthy controls (CTL) and individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), including a subset characterized neuropathologically at autopsy.\n\nMethodsProximity extension assay (Olink Explore(R)) quantified 2,779 plasma proteins in 22 RHI patients (all AD-biomarker negative), 39 biomarker-confirmed AD, and 44 CTL. A subset of participants went to autopsy (N=16) allowing for comparisons of the antemortem plasma proteome between autopsy-confirmed CTE+ (N=7) and CTE-(N=9). Differential abundance and co-expression network analyses identified plasma proteomic signatures of RHI, which were functionally annotated using gene ontology and cell type enrichment analysis. Nonparametric correlations examined plasma proteomic associations with orthogonally-measured plasma biomarkers, global cognitive function, and semi-quantitative ratings of neuropathology burden at autopsy.\n\nResultsDifferential abundance analysis revealed 434 increased (vs. 6 decreased) proteins in RHI vs. CTL and 193 increased (vs. 14 decreased) in RHI vs. AD. Network analysis identified 9 protein co-expression modules (M1-M9), of which 7 were elevated in RHI compared to AD or CTL. Modules with increased abundance in RHI were enriched for mitochondrial/metabolic, cell division, and immunovascular (e.g., cell adhesion, TNF-signaling) processes. RHI-related modules exhibited strong and selective correlations with immunoassay-based plasma IL-6 in RHI cases, including the M2 TNF-signaling/cell adhesion module which harbored proteins that strongly tracked with cognitive function. RHI-related plasma protein signatures were similar in the subset of participants with autopsy-confirmed CTE, including immune and metabolic modules that positively correlated with medial temporal lobe tau and TDP-43 burden.\n\nConclusionsMolecular pathways in plasma most consistently implicated in RHI were tied to immune response, mitochondrial function, and cell metabolism. RHI-related proteomic signatures tracked with antemortem cognitive severity and postmortem neuropathological burden, providing converging evidence for their role in disease progression. Differentially abundant proteins and co-expression modules in RHI may inform mechanisms linking RHI to increased dementia risk, thus guiding diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic development for at-risk populations.",

Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms by which neuronal cells respond to copper depletion in multiple genetic model systems. Targeted deletion of CTR1 in neuroblastoma clonal cell lines produced copper deficiency that was associated with compromised copper-dependent Golgi and mitochondrial enzymes and a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation. Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed simultaneous upregulation of mTORC1 and S6K signaling, along with reduced PERK signaling in CTR1 KO cells. Patterns of gene and protein expression and pharmacogenomics show increased activation of the mTORC1-S6K pathway as a pro-survival mechanism, ultimately resulting in increased protein synthesis as measured by puromycin labeling. These effects of copper depletion were corroborated by spatial transcriptomic profiling of the cerebellum of Atp7aflx/Y :: Vil1Cre/+ mice, in which copper-deficient Purkinje cells exhibited upregulated protein synthesis machinery and expression of mTORC1-S6K pathway genes. We tested whether increased activity of mTOR in copper-deficient neurons was adaptive or deleterious by genetic epistasis experiments in Drosophila. Copper deficiency dendritic phenotypes in class IV neurons are partially rescued by increased S6k expression or 4E-BP1 (Thor) RNAi, while epidermis phenotypes are exacerbated by Akt, S6k, or raptor RNAi. Overall, we demonstrate that increased mTORC1-S6K pathway activation and protein synthesis is an adaptive mechanism by which neuronal cells respond to copper depletion.\n\nSignificance StatementCopper dysregulation is present in neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neurological conditions ranging from rare conditions such as Menkes disease and CTR1 deficiency to more common diseases like Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the precise mechanisms through which copper deficiency leads to pathology and the survival mechanisms by which the brain exhibits resilience remain unknown. We demonstrate that in a human cell line, Drosophila, and the mouse cerebellum, copper-depleted neuronal cells exhibit increased protein synthesis through two distinct signaling pathways: mTORC1 activation and decreased PERK (EIF2AK3) activity. This upregulation of protein synthesis facilitates resilience of neuronal cells to copper deficiency, including partial restoration of dendritic arborization. Our findings offer a new framework for understanding copper deficiency-related pathology in neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Epitranscriptomic modifications modulate diverse biological processes, such as regulation of gene expression, abundance, location and function. In particular, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation has been shown to regulate various disease processes, including cancer and inflammation. While there is evidence that m6A modification is functionally relevant in neural development and differentiation, the role of m6A modification in HIV neuropathogenesis is unknown. Here, we identified direct m6A modifications in miRNAs from BG tissues of Rhesus macaques (RMs) that were either vehicle-treated uninfected (VEH), SIV-infected and combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) and VEH treated (VEH/SIV/cART), or THC:CBD treated (THC:CBD/SIV/cART). We detected m6A modifications across all three treatment groups. SIV infection promoted an overall hypomethylated m6A profile. While the overall hypomethylated m6A profile was not significantly impacted by THC:CBD treatment, specific miRNAs, particularly those predicted to target proinflammatory genes showed markedly reduced m6A methylation levels compared to the VEH treated RMs. Additionally, we found that specific BG tissue miRNAs bearing m6A epi-transcriptomic marks were also transferred and detected in BG-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Mechanistically, we identified the DRACH motif of the seed region of miR-194-5p to be significantly m6A hypomethylated, which was predicted to directly target STAT1, an important interferon-activated transcription factor known to drive neuroinflammation, in diseases ranging from Alzheimers to Parkinsons and Huntingtons disease. Notably, THC:CBD treatments significantly reduced m6A methylation of 44 miRNA species directly involved in regulating CNS network genes, thus providing a possible mechanistic explanation underlying the beneficial effects of THC:CBD in several diseases involving neuroinflammation. Our findings also underscore the need for investigating the qualitative, and posttranscriptional modifications in RNA along with the more traditional, quantitative alterations in pathological conditions or in response to disease modifying treatments.\n\nHighlightsO_LISIV infection induced significant m6A modification changes in basal ganglia (BG) miRNA.\nC_LIO_LIm6A hypomethylated miRNAs are abundant in BG tissues of infected rhesus macaques (RM).\nC_LIO_LIm6A epitranscriptomic marks in BG miRNAs of infected RMs are linked to neuroinflammation network genes.\nC_LIO_LIBG tissue miRNAs with m6A epitranscriptomic marks are present in BG-derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs).\nC_LIO_LITarget genes of EV-Tissue miRNAs with m6A epitranscriptomic marks have diverse predictive functions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, represents one of the main clinical challenges of the century as the number of patients is predicted to triple by 2050. Despite the recent approval of three monoclonal antibodies targeting Amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) aggregates by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), immunotherapies still face challenges due to the difficulty of antibodies crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This necessitates administering large doses of drugs to achieve their therapeutic effects, which is associated with significant side effects. In this context, low-intensity focused ultrasound (LiFUS) appears as an innovative and non-invasive method which, in association with intravenous injection of microbubbles (MB), leads to a transient BBB opening. This innovative strategy has been extensively studied in different preclinical models and more recently in human clinical trials, particularly in the context of AD. LiFUS+MB seems to increase the inflammatory response at short term, but the time course of this response is not consistent between studies, certainly due to the discrepancy between LiFUS protocols used. Moreover, the impact at longer term is understudied and the mechanisms underlying this effect are still not well understood. In our study, we therefore used the TgF344-AD rat model of AD, to investigate the effect of a single or multiple exposures to LiFUS+MB in the entire brain, on inflammatory response and amyloid load. The ultrasound attenuation through the skull was corrected to apply a peak negative acoustic pressure of 450 kHz in all treated animals. Single LiFUS+MB exposure induces a slight astrocyte and microglial response 24 hours post-treatment whereas repeated LiFUS treatment seems to induce microglial reprogramming, leading to the adaptation of gene expression related to key functions such as inflammatory response, mitochondrial and energetic metabolism. In our rat model and LiFUS+MB protocol conditions, multiple exposures did not modulate soluble/poorly aggregated forms nor the highly aggregated forms of A{beta}40 and A{beta}42. For therapeutic AD management, LiFUS+MB could be combined with drugs such as immunotherapies. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we validated that LiFUS was also efficient to improve the brain entry of the anti-A{beta} antibody, Aducanumab.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound can non-invasively penetrate deep into brain for neuromodulation and has demonstrated good potential for clinical application. Excitation or inhibition of neurons by ultrasound has been reported, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. So far most in vitro studies have focused on the activation of individual neurons by ultrasound with calcium imaging. As the focal region of ultrasound is typically millimeter or submillimeter size, it is important to investigate yet so far unclear how the mechanical effects of ultrasound would influence on the synaptic circuit activity of neurons.\n\nMethodsLow-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) (25 MHz, 5% duty cycle, 5 Hz pulse repetition frequency, 0.4 - 1.6 W/cm2) was used to stimulate cultured hippocampal neurons. Action potentials and excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded in individual cells with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We also simultaneously imaged intracellular calcium, along with neuronal electrical signals, to resolve neuronal network dynamics during LIPUS.\n\nResultsExcitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked by LIPUS in high-density neuronal cultures. Both the frequency and amplitude of EPSCs increased, indicating enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The probability of evoking responses, as well as the total charge of EPSCs evoked by ultrasound, increased with ultrasound intensity. Mechanistic analysis reveals that extracellular calcium influx, action potential (AP) firing and synaptic transmission are necessary for the responses to ultrasound in the high-density culture. In contrast, EPSCs were not enhanced in cultures with low densities of neurons. Simultaneous calcium imaging of neuronal network activity indicated that recurrent excitatory network activity is recruited during ultrasound stimulation in high-density cultures.\n\nConclusionUltrasound can activate recurrent neuronal network activity, caused by excitatory synaptic transmission, over tens to hundreds of seconds. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms involved in the response of the brain to ultrasound and illuminates the potential to use ultrasound to regulate synaptic function in neurological disorders that involve synaptic dysfunction, such as Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/614451v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd419org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@91d93corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d0c14org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@153f7c4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "It is of critical importance to our understanding of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology to determine how key pathological factors are interconnected and implicated in nerve cell death, clinical symptoms, and disease progression. The formation of extracellular beta-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques is the major pathological hallmark of AD and A{beta} has been suggested to be a critical inducer of AD, driving disease pathogenesis. Exactly how A{beta} plaque formation begins and how ongoing plaque deposition proceeds and initiates subsequent neurotoxic mechanisms is not well understood.\n\nThe primary aim of our research is to elucidate the biochemical processes underlying early A{beta} plaque formation in brain tissue. We recently introduced a chemical imaging paradigm based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and metabolic isotope labelling to follow stable isotope labelling kinetics (iSILK) in vivo to track the in vivo build-up and deposition of A{beta}. Herein, knock-in A{beta} mouse models (AppNL-F) that develop A{beta} pathology gradually are metabolically labeled with stable isotopes. This chemical imaging approach timestamps amyloid plaques during the period of initial deposition allowing the fate of aggregating A{beta} species from before and during the earliest events of plaque pathology through plaque maturation to be tracked. To identify the molecular and cellular response to plaque maturation, we integrated iSILK with single plaque transcriptomics performed on adjacent tissue sections. This enabled changes in gene expression to be tracked as a function of plaque age (as encoded in the A{beta} peptide isotopologue pattern) distinct from changes due to the chronological age or pathological severity. This approach identified that plaque age correlates negatively with gene expression patterns associated with synaptic function as early as in 10-month-old animals but persists into 18 months. Finally, we integrated hyperspectral confocal microscopy into our multiomic approach to image amyloid structural isomers, revealing a positive correlation between plaque age and amyloid structural maturity. This analysis identified three categories of plaques, each with a distinct impact on the surrounding microenvironment. Here, we identified that older, more compact plaques were associated with the most significant synapse loss and toxicity.\n\nThese data show how isotope-encoded MS imaging can be used to delineate A{beta} toxicity dynamics in vivo. Moreover, we show for the first time a functional integration of dynamic MSI, structural plaque imaging and whole genome-wide spatial transcriptomics at the single plaque level. This multiomic approach offers an unprecedented combination of temporal and spatial resolution enabling a description of the earliest events of precipitating amyloid pathology and how A{beta} modulates synaptotoxic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH), which are brain lesions associated with cerebral small vessel disease and aging, signify fiber loss and pruning. Analysis of T2-FLAIR MRI data from the NACC cohort, including cognitively normal (CN), cognitively impaired (CI), and Alzheimers disease (CI-AD) subjects, revealed that a significant subset of participants, even those classified as CN, harbor substantial periventricular (PVWMH) and deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) loads, while others displayed minimal or no PVWMH and DWMH, across ages 50-94 years. In this study, we quantified the thresholds and progression kinetics of PVWMH and DWMH and their impact on cognitive performance and neuroanatomic changes in the aging cohort (NCN = 521, NCI = 146, NCI-AD = 319). Our findings explore the impact of PVWMH and DWMH loads on global and specific cognitive domains to determine whether cognitive impairments are directly induced by PVWMH and DWMH loads, or mediated through distinct neuroanatomic structures. PV and DWMH loads are higher in CI and CI-AD subjects compared to CN but the PVWMH and DWMH loads are not discriminative of CI and CI-AD. The progression kinetics of PVWMH and DWMH volume with age indicate an exponential rate of increase, with PVWMH escalating approximately twice as fast as DWMH particularly around an inflection point at 61 years of age. PVWMH load presents with increased probability of occurrence in frontal horn compared to occipital horn while DWMH is diffused and accumulates significantly at later age than that observed for PVWMH. Multivariate global regression suggested significant effect (p<0.01) of PVWMH on Trail making tests (TMTs)-A and B (executive function), animal naming tests (semantic memory), with no significant effects observed for DWMH load. Indeed, beyond a threshold of PVWMH volume >2.3 mL, significant deficits in TMTs were observed compared to the subjects without PVWMH load. A PVWMH volume >2.3 mL and DWMH >2.75 mL is significantly associated with impairments in attention & working memory (Digit Span Tests), and semantic memory. Noticeably, significant neuroanatomic atrophy in the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, RMFG, precentral, and paracentral gyrus is observed for PVWMH load >2.3 mL, while DWMH load was not significantly associated with neuroanatomic loss. Furthermore, a mediation model employing neuroanatomic volumes as mediator, PVWMH load as predictor and cognitive tests as outcome suggested that PVWMH volume contributes significantly to deficits in TMT-B mediated through atrophy in precentral gyrus (64%), accumbens (39%), paracentral gyrus (32%), rostral middle frontal gyrus (31%), and lingual gyrus (30%), each contributing distinct proportions, alongside the direct effect. DWMH load did not emerge as a significant predictor (direct or indirect) for the cognitive deficits. Further, no significant neuroanatomic mediations from PVWMH load were observed for other cognitive tests indicative of direct involvement of PVWMH load. Global cognition like MMSE was affected only at a higher PVWMH accumulation (>6 ml).\n\nHighlightsO_LIPVWMH escalates exponentially twice as fast as DWMH with age.\nC_LIO_LIPVWMH >2.3 mL is linked to cognitive deficits in executive function, semantic memory and neuroanatomic atrophy; DWMH less impactful.\nC_LIO_LIPVWMH, not DWMH, significantly affects cognitive decline via a unique set of brain structural loss.\nC_LIO_LIPVWMH and DWMH loads are not discriminative of CI and AD subjects.\nC_LI\n\nOverview\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/610993v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ff66b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af3852org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ab4c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d226a6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Lack of physical activity has been associated with multiple diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, Alzheimers disease (AD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), Parkinsons disease, depression, dementia and even cancer. Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.\n\nTo our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of \"healthy sedentary\" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in \"healthy sedentary\" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.\n\nNineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.\n\nFor our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.\n\nResting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.\n\nExercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that \"healthy sedentary\" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.\n\nSince large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=186 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/608601v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b0f8e4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a472d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f969corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10912de_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG CONCLUSIONS- Sedentary individuals possess significant decreases in mitochondrial respiration as well as muscle bioenergetics during resting conditions compared to moderately active individuals.\n- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).\n- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies.
